Highly configurable designed for modpacks.\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/xZQOoOaY/images/d25be3aea43e3846b31108b43717edc1386d9e7c.png)\n\n## Feature\n- Footprint gen on low hardness block (by default).\n  - Baby mob has a baby print.\n  - Spider & horse has special pos to gen.\n- Waterprint gen when touched water for a while.\n- Minecart Spark.\n- Boat trail (water and land is difference).\n- Swimming Pop.\n- Raise dust when walking on snow.\n- [Pehkui](https://modrinth.com/mod/pehkui) support.\n- [Random Mob Sizes](http://modrinth.com/mod/random-mob-sizes) support.\n\n## Configurable\nYou can config its lifetime, frequency, and others through `Cloth Config` and `Mod Menu`.\n- Which type / specific block can (or not) gen.\n- Which mob can (or not) gen.\n- What print size for specific mob.\n- How high where is print gen on specific block (snow etc.)\n- Which mob regarded as spider / horse (to gen on special way).\n- Which texture should specific mob gen.\n- More as you wish...\n\n![](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/xZQOoOaY/images/55ff3253c479a32a7d0441ad639a83ee890032e0.png)\n\n### Custom Print Texture\n1.Make a resourcepack and put your `texture.png`s to the path below:\n```\nassets\\footprintparticle\\textures\\particle\\\n```\n2.Make a `footprint.json` or copy one from the mod.jar to your resourcepack path below (or `watermark.json` if you wanna replace watermark at same time):\n```\nassets\\footprintparticle\\particles\\\n```\n3.Add your `texture.png`s file name to the .json, formatting like:\n\n```\n{\n  \"textures\": [\n    \"footprintparticle:footprint\",  // delete this line if you don't need default ugly print :)\n    \"footprintparticle:texture1\",\n    \"footprintparticle:texture2\",\n    \"footprintparticle: ...\"  // remember last line NOT have comma (\",\")\n  ]\n}\n```\n4.Packing and install your pack into the game, enabled your resourcepack, then go to the config screen and edit the \"Custom Print Texture\" option as tooltip says:\n```\nminecraft:cat,texture1,texture2\nminecraft:cow,texture1\nmodid:mobid,textureName\n...\n```\n5.Enjoy!\n\n## Dependence\n\nSince 0.3.1c we now support Forge & Fabric in a same jar, but dependence has some differ:\n\n### For all loader\n- **Architectury API** is required.\n- **Cloth Config** is required to manage config file & build configScreen.\n\n### Fabric extra needs\n- **Fabric API** is required.\n- **Mod Menu** is optional to access configScreen.\n\n## Contact\nAny suggestions are welcome to

alt=\"CIT Resewn\" width=\"247\" height=\"247\"></center>\n<center>CIT Resewn is MCPatcher's CIT features re-written outside of optifine as a standalone mod for fabric</center>\n\n[<center><img src=\"https://citresewn.shcm.io/img/project_description/docs.png\" alt=\"Go to the docs for more info!\" width=\"268\" height=\"53\"></center>](https://citresewn.shcm.io/)\n\n[<center><img

What does it do?\nMCPatcher had a feature called Custom Item Textures(or CIT for short) which was later adopted by Optifine.\n\nCustom Item Textures allowed resourcepacks to replace the appearance of items when they met certain conditions.\n\nCIT Resewn does exactly that but as a standalone Fabric mod which does not require MCPatcher nor Optifine!\n\nOn top of that, CIT Resewn aims to build upon the concept of CITs by expanding the available types and conditions.\n\n### How is it different than MCPatcher/Optifine's CIT?\nCIT Resewn is intended to be fully backwards compatible with the old Optifine/MCPatcher packs. Though there are some key differences.\n\nFirst, the numeric id system was removed since the Flattening. Packs utilizing the so called \"magic numbers\" instead of the new text ids will not work.\n\nSecond, Optifine and old minecraft versions have a bug which allows resourcepacks to put files in malformatted(or \"broken\") paths.<br>\nThese are paths that contain \"Non (lower cased) a-z, 0-9, dots, underscores and dashes\" characters within either the file name or its parent directories. In the case that you must use such a broken pack, there is a compromise set up which is still highly experimental and not recommended. You can go to CIT Resewn's settings and allow broken paths. (I'm serious, this is not recommended at all)\n\nLastly, to ensure compatibility with foreign packs, CITs will be loaded from .properties files under:\n`assets/minecraft/citresewn/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/optifine/cit`\n`assets/minecraft/mcpatcher/cit`\n\n### Does CIT Resewn support Optifine/Sodium?\nWhile CIT Resewn is designed to work without any performance mod needed, I will try my best to ensure it is compatible with Sodium.\n\nWith all that said, there will not be support for Optifine at all.\n\nThere were also discussions around Sodium alternatives such as Canvas.<br>\nMy official statement on compatibility with these mods is \"if it works it works\" unless I say otherwise.\n\n### What about Forge?\nForge is being kinda doodoo recently and Fabric's Mixins is what allows the mod to inject cits into vanilla so smoothly.\n\nDo not ask for a forge port or I'll break your elbows.\n\n### 1.16/other versions?\nSee [Issues#120](https://github.com/SHsuperCM/CITResewn/issues/120)\n\n<strike>If a version says it's for 1.x, it means it is aimed to work on all of 1.x's minor versions but specifically recommended for its listed minor version.</strike><br>\nWell not anymore!

you would like to show a token of your appreciation for my work, and help support the development of Sodium in the process, then consider [buying me a coffee](https://jellysquid.me/donate).\n\n<a href=\"https://caffeinemc.net/donate\"><img src=\"https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/kofi2.png?v=3\" width=\"180\"/></a>\n\n---\n\n<center>\n <img

margin is added before the following Markdown -->\n </p>\n</center>\n\nSodium is a powerful rendering engine and optimization mod for Minecraft 1.16+ which greatly improves performance and graphical quality. It boasts wide compatibility with the Fabric mod ecosystem when compared to other rendering-focused mods, and it does so without compromising on how the game looks, giving you that authentic block game feel.\n<h1 id=\"installation\">📥 Installation Guide</h1>\n\n**Please make sure you read the <a href=\"https://github.com/CaffeineMC/sodium-fabric/wiki/Driver-Compatibility\">Driver Compatibility</a> section on our wiki before you install Sodium. It contains important instructions on how to prevent crashes and other performance problems.**\n\nSodium is a Fabric mod, which means it requires the [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use). If you are using a third-party launcher, it probably has built-in functionality to automatically install mod loaders. Once you have installed Fabric Loader, you can simply place Sodium into your _mods folder_ like anything else.\n\n**Not sure if you installed the mod correctly?** Check your _Video Settings_ screen in Minecraft, which should show our new and improved user interface for changing settings.\n\n**Not sure how to configure the mod?** Don't worry, you probably don't need to. By default, Sodium will enable all optimizations which are supported on your system, giving you the best experience possible. You should generally only change video settings related to performance and other advanced features if you are experiencing issues.\n\n**Need even more performance?** By design, Sodium only optimizes the rendering code of Minecraft. You should also install our other mods, such as [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) (for MC 1.15+) and [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) (for MC <1.19), to optimize the other parts of your game. This is done so that players can pick and choose which mods they want to use, but we generally recommend using [our entire collection](https://modrinth.com/user/jellysquid3).\n\n<h1 id=\"hardware-compatibility\">✅ Hardware Compatibility</h1>\n\nWe only support graphics cards which have up-to-date drivers that are compatible with OpenGL 4.6. Most graphics cards released in the past 12 years are compatible. This includes the following hardware:\n\n- INTEL HD Graphics 500 Series (Skylake) or newer\n- NVIDIA GeForce 400 Series (Fermi) or newer\n- AMD Radeon HD 7000 Series (GCN 1) or newer\n \nIn some cases, older graphics cards may also work (so long as they have up-to-date drivers which have support for OpenGL 3.3), but they are not officially supported, and may not be compatible with future versions of Sodium.\n\nAndroid devices which use OpenGL translation layers (such as GL4ES, ANGLE, etc) are not supported and will very likely not work with Sodium. These translation layers do not implement required functionality and they suffer from underlying driver bugs which cannot be worked around.\n\nIf you are running into problems, you should make sure that your graphics drivers are up-to-date. Out-of-date graphics drivers are often the reason for most crashes, rendering bugs, and performance issues.\n\n# 🐛 How to Report Issues\n\nPlease use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/jellysquid3/sodium-fabric/issues) linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues. Make sure you include information about the mods you are using, and attach any crash/log files you have.\n\n# ❓ Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWe have a short wiki with some of the most frequently asked questions [here](https://github.com/CaffeineMC/caffeine-meta/wiki/FAQ). More likely than not, your question already has an answer here.\n\n# ⚙️ Technical details\n\nSo, how exactly does Sodium work? We obviously cannot just say that the game is magically faster without providing some kind of explanation. The following list tries to cover some of the most significant changes which are responsible for our performance improvements, but it's not complete or exhaustive of everything Sodium does.\n\n- We replace all of Minecraft's world rendering code with our own implementation that is built upon modern rendering techniques. For chunk rendering, we make use of _geometry batching_ and _draw pass consolidation_, which greatly reduces the amount of CPU overhead involved in rendering the world. Sodium isn't just an optimization mod... it's more like a rendering engine.\n\n- We use a much more compact format for world geometry, which allows for up to a ~40% reduction in the amount of video memory used by chunks. Additionally, we make use of a second culling pass to eliminate geometry which is facing away from the camera (but still within the camera's view) so that the GPU does not need to process hidden geometry. Together, these optimizations reduce video memory bandwidth requirements significantly, which is one of the game's biggest bottlenecks.\n\n- We use a fully-rewritten system for generating chunk geometry, including the biome colorization, lighting, and shading passes. This is often much faster than the vanilla code, which helps to make chunk loading faster and less CPU-intensive. ([before](https://streamable.com/3taw22), [after](https://streamable.com/4pesh2))\n\n- We use a custom threading implementation which ensures chunk updates are better able to take advantage of multi-core CPUs, which greatly reduces the lag spikes that are caused by placing/breaking blocks.

This noticeably improves performance in heavy scenes, such as when many entities are visible.\n\n- We've made numerous improvements to how the game manages memory and allocates objects, which in turn reduces memory consumption and lag spikes caused by garbage collector activity.\n\n- Animated textures which are not visible in the world are not updated, speeding up texture updating on most hardware (especially AMD cards.)\n\nMany people are used to performance optimization meaning that the game will look worse, but in our case, we actually improve the graphical fidelity of Minecraft in most situations.\n\n- Biome colors for blocks and fluids are smoothed across block faces, providing greatly improved graphical quality that is significantly less computationally intensive.

I recommend blacklisting the logs and leaves in the mod config.\n- **Physics mod:** I will not make compatibility because it's not open sourced, if compatibility should ever be a thing, then the creators of the Physics mod should add it.\n\n---\n### Do you need a cheap Minecraft server and want to support me, click the banner below and sign up, you can also use my code to get 15% off you

Ideally you'd name them image1.png, image2.png, image3.png, etc.\nYou can include background images in any resource pack and easily pack them in with any other resources.\n\n![example](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cached_images/816548bb07ab6d4c2b116ab88eb868316c81a21c.png)\n\nIt is essential to place the pack.mcmeta. Create a notepad with that name and put the following text:\n\n\n```\n{ \n  \"pack\": {\n    \"pack_format\": 15,\n    \"description\": \"Loading Backgrounds images\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n\nAlso, you can look at this resourcepack as an [example](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/loading-backgrounds-loading-images).\n\n![FAQ](https://www.bisecthosting.com/images/CF/Loading_Backgrounds/BH_LB_banner1.webp)\n\n### Does it work on servers?\n### \nSure!

What about Resource Packs?\n  - Falling Leaves _should_ be 100% compatible with any modded trees and any resource pack changing leaves!\n\n- Does this need to be installed on the server for multiplayer?\n  - Nope! This mod is 100% client-side.\n\n- Lol fabric suxxx gief forge plx.\n  - Cheaterpaul [ported this mod to Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-forge \"Forge port\"), note that this port is inofficial and might not always be up-to-date, it also does configuration differently.\n\n- Do you have any screenshots I could look at before I install this?\n  - Sure! Check out the [images section](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/falling-leaves-fabric/screenshots) of this mod's Curseforge page.  \n    (Note that they are slightly out of date.)\n\n- I enjoy old things. Can you backport this to Minecraft 1.7?\n  - No. We will only focus on supporting the most recently released version of Minecraft.\n\n- I found a problem / have an idea! Do I just post a comment on your CurseForge page?\n  - You **could**, but we'd prefer it if you posted an issue on [our GitHub repository's issue tracker](https://github.com/RandomMcSomethin/fallingleaves/issues).  \n    It makes it far easier for us to follow up when developing new versions of this mod.\n\n- Can I include this mod in my modpack?\n  - Absolutely! Just remember to put a link to our CurseForge page somewhere in your modpack's documentation.\n\n- What do you get if you jumble the letters in \"Falling Leaves Mod\"?\n  - You get \"Five Golden Llamas\". We're still not sure if this means anything in particular...","published":"2021-01-28T16:09:11.540414Z","updated":"2024-06-03T11:27:09.153377Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2026142,"followers":2540,"categories":["decoration"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","21w41a","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["Lz5UGUqe","qBn758ZA","xQRdGvDT","QTn4WxFz","Vx5ygkPc","mqyNUioD","gqfXCbT3","oHAko2xm","RdpuJfjg","a7SgCh8W","KlJ03K3I","FaCaUOFs","jPEjJST0","dWryIdUY","uFJKVYDV","XiehU3ne","7bo5KA2S","aufE28Na","nlfT2jHV","SjhvzbUC","n7dcLucW","bSrG4Fxf","ZMbS4EYg","XYq90g2b","OSEfdzSy","HMfGMPn2","8qK6ANpJ","mva7rKdl","KpvXCE2X","PNG0Dp43","flPXaySR","P5urckC8","tdF6zGZX","5wXruaFu"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WhbRG4iK/icon.gif"},"version":{"id":"KpvXCE2X","project_id":"WhbRG4iK","author_id":"INxNlPeV","featured":false,"name":"1.15.4","version_number":"1.15.4","changelog":"add an option to turn off \"block breaking leaves\" (on-hit and on-decay) on a per-block basis","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-07T18:30:04.660427Z","downloads":1021177,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"5101bd05c678a874c1fa40c3363d1c127f7074d5","sha512":"60bdf742d75a7836809087fed4e92da23dd24a09a2f222e5d2807a0fe6f1dfeff9c42c1a3cb84d20d93b3c8045b349f805d3b7b4eee4278dfe5bfe3b9bd2ebc1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WhbRG4iK/versions/KpvXCE2X/fallingleaves-1.15.4%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"fallingleaves-1.15.4+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":153985,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"}],"game_versions":["1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"n4QH7y5y","username":"BrekiTomasson","name":"Breki Tomasson","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7026735?v=4","bio":"- Lead developer at TankerTrackers.com \r\n- Always juggling 20-something programming projects \r\n- <3 clean code & good code hygiene.\r\n- Java, PHP, NodeJS","created":"2021-01-28T07:40:11.099939Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"INxNlPeV","username":"Fourmisain","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/8464472?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-24T22:05:23.378029Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"sv3saz9X","user":{"id":"GHOKC5y2","username":"randommcsomethin","name":"Adam Malkovitch","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/34224353?v=4","bio":"Chief Egg Officer of the refridgerator","created":"2021-03-22T20:48:30.163379Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"flPXaySR","project_id":"WhbRG4iK","author_id":"INxNlPeV","featured":false,"name":"1.15.6","version_number":"1.15.6+1.20.1","changelog":"Allow controlling the spawn rate of vanilla Cherry Petals!

This mod changes that by doing a calculation once they get within simulation distance and update them so it's like they never left the simulation distance.\nSo now you can explore while waiting for crops to grow or furnaces to cook.\n\nThis also works similarly when skipping the night, crops will have grown and furnaces will have cooked as if you were awake the entire time waiting for the day.\n\n## Here is a video showcasing the mod.\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/c1hAEfe_zVY\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\n\n## Currently supported blocks/entities (if you use the latest version):\n- All crops\n- Furnaces\n- Saplings\n- Bushes\n- Cocoa beans\n- Sugar canes\n- Baby animals\n- Copper blocks\n- Cactus\n- Leaves\n- Amethyst\n- Kelp\n- Glow berries\n- Bamboo\n- Turtle eggs\n- Snow\n- Water freezing\n- Cauldrons\n- Dripstone\n\n\n## Currently planned:\n- Updating blocks in account of each other\n- Support for other mods (probably once this mod is out of beta)\n\n# Inspiration\nI got this idea from a [video by DigiDigger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIDbhVPHZbs&t=311s) where he talks about how Terraria can handle all of its tiles.\nEven though the video isn't really accurate to how Terraria actually works, he did bring up an optimisation which I feel like could also be implemented to Minecraft.\nThe timestamp where he talks about this optimisation is at 5:11.\n\n# Simulation accuracy:\nInstead of using bruteforce and repeatedly ticking blocks/entities for the amount it was unloaded,\nthe mod instead has a simulation function for every supported block/entity which will calculate the state of a block/entity after a certain amount of time.\nThe most complicated things to simulate are blocks which use randomness in their ticks.\nTo be able to simulate these we randomly sample from a [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution)\nand sometimes also a [negative binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_binomial_distribution)\nto get what state the blocks should be in after a certain amount of time.\nBy doing this, you will get pretty accurate results without bruteforce.\n\nHowever, some blocks do stuff that I am not able to find a good way to simulate.\nBecause of this, certain blocks will not be accurately simulated.\\\nHere's a list of those blocks:\n- **Copper blocks**\\\n  The copper oxidation speed and max oxidation depends on how many blocks of copper are nearby and the state of those copper blocks.\n  Right now my mod simulates one block at a time which means that I won't be able to accurately simulate blocks that are dependent on other blocks.\n  This results in copper blocks being very inaccurate. However, when spaced optimally the simulation will be pretty accurate.\n  Except that the first oxidation step has a lower chance of happening compared to the rest.\n  To not have to deal with that as well I just made all steps have that lower chance.\n\n- **Water freezing**\\\n  This has pretty much the same problem as copper blocks. Normally ice only generates if one of the surrounding blocks also is not water.\n  The way my mod handles it is that it doesn't. I was too lazy to come up with any decent alternative, so I just used the original logic if a position is valid for ice to generate.\n  This will definitely be fixed in the future once I come up with a good way to simulate multiple blocks together.\n\n- **Turtle eggs**\\\n  The turtle eggs doesn't really have any issues regarding accuracy. The biggest issue I had was what age the turtles should have once hatched, but I managed to solve it.\n  I just wanted to mention that the accurate simulation can be a slight bit more expensive. So there's an option to turn it off.\n\nAnything that didn't get mentioned here most likely has a pretty accurate simulation function with no issues at all.\n\n# Feedback / Suggestions\nIf you got any feedback or suggestions for this mod, feel free to join my [discord server](https://discord.gg/aF3sqRN5Ja)!","published":"2023-01-13T17:24:25.380684Z","updated":"2024-06-01T16:19:31.537243Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":79803,"followers":156,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["qU7uAolt","Hf5FHLOo","WEOmyuCf","Ys1q4li3","fmK3nEro","oPCmTlls","CPPQjLB8","lzxNgMFS","pcGOiVxF","awH2Y9ZR","mxZIsSUZ","Be4AU3hV","ultxutIS","7TKrftl2","1bNcDNft","ZK9TnJzX","BcAmGpeo","vEZsvgSa","ZaII6ngO","feyrShJx","vh74CCdJ","zKiryBj8","hqwioCvS","YCtCcMxp","MMF00JcD","OwWzinMd","bTtdBuFE","12E4ZDei","Uefv4s3S","MmWMDC3H","oDEs6DFd","QC2uohtf","tJirVcyQ","xdW3fTZy","DWgVikFG","Cb6q6J0E"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Oo4rJCDP/93a3088c3a24a8ba744374d30f69e6619236fe70.png"},"version":{"id":"zKiryBj8","project_id":"Oo4rJCDP","author_id":"g9JFBPBn","featured":false,"name":"Unloaded Activity v0.5.0+1.20-1.20.1","version_number":"v0.5.0+1.20-1.20.1","changelog":"## Bug fixes\n- Improved pumpkin/melon simulation to be more accurate.\n\n## Changes\n- Restructuring of internal code.\n- Restructuring of config menu.\n\n## Additions\n- Support for 1.20.2.\n- Mod now remembers block positions which will make it much faster at simulating chunks, aswell as an option to turn it off if you want.\n- Save weather info for use in simulation.\n- Ability to simulate Precipitation Ticks.\n- Simple benchmark command for developer.

The structures themselves are a bit \nmore detailed than their vanilla counterparts, but they still fit seamlessly \ninto the world. Not only that but many are inspired by real-life buildings or \narchitectural styles, giving them a fresh new feel. There are over 50 structures \nadded by Towns and Towers so far (as of update 1.9), so have fun exploring! And \nremember, it’s not the destination that’s important, but the journey to get \nthere.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <font color=\"#FFE16A\">If you wish to see all \nof the structures our mod adds, take a look at our gallery </font>\n<a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/CCZbqMn\">here</a>.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</h3>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Compatibility</u></strong></h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For a full list of mods \nthat are currently compatible with Towns and towers, please look\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gE5DvsPwztTtCVi_i6nEOLQM6tm8NU4Q1iCpuqHY2UM/edit\">\nhere</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pack should be \ncompatible with most world generation mods, like Terralith, WWOO, BYG, BoP, \netc., as well as mods that add also add new structures/villages, such as \nRepurposed Structures or ChoiceTheorem's Overhauled Villages. However, some \nfeatures from other mods are not currently present, like the guards from \nVillager Guards mod or certain buildings from Farmer's Delight for example. This \nwill be addressed in the future via a series of datapacks, which will implement \nfeatures from those mods into ours.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 align=\"center\"><strong><u>Frequently Asked Questions</u></strong></h2>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>1. Is it safe to update Towns and \nTowers to a newer version?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general yes. Just \nnote that sometimes when we update a few things get changed, so there might be a \nbit of console spam. If any serious problems arise because of that, let us know. \nAnd, as always, make backups. Better be safe than sorry.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>2. Is it safe to add \nTowns and Towers to an already existing world?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yep. Just note that the \nnew structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>3. Is this mod for \nForge or Fabric/Quilt?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both. We have a \nuniversal version for both (now three?) mod loaders.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>4. How can I locate the new \nstructures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.18.2: /locate \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For 1.19+: /locate structure \ntowns_and_towers:[structure_from_list]<br>\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note that some structures have the exclusives tag added \nin front. Those structures cannot be located if you only have T&amp;T installed. You \nalso need to have one of the mods that T&amp;T is paired with. For a full list, \nscroll down below (if I remember to add it...).<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>5. Does Towns and Towers modify \nexisting vanilla structures?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the latest \nupdate, no. Only new structures are added.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-size: 12pt; font-weight: 700\"><strong>6. What about the \nloot of these structures?</strong></span></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The majority of \nstructures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the \nCompatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot \ntables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find \npillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as \nwell as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armor, and \nother goodies.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>7. How can I report \nbugs/issues/suggestions?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Write them down below \nin the comments and I’ll try to answer them as soon as possible and as best as \npossible. I’m still relatively new to all of this, so excuse that.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>8. Can I include Towns and Towers \ninto my modpack?</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sure, but make sure to \ngive credit and a link to our page, and make sure you don't include a modified \nversion of our mod.<br>\n&nbsp;</p>\n<h3><b><span style=\"font-size: 12pt\"><strong>9. 1.16.5???</strong></span></b></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho\">\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DTvrv4f3Yho</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><u>Credits</u></strong></h2>\n<ul style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n<li>Kubek as the original author of Towns and Towers;</li>\n<li>William Wythers, ChoiceTheorem, Apollo, Robified and TelepathicGrunt for \nbeing based;</li>\n<li>Various other creators and their builds for being a massive inspiration \n(check out our Planet Minecraft page\n<a href=\"https://www.planetminecraft.com/data-pack/towns-amp-towers-structure-overhaul/\">\nhere</a> for a full list)</li>\n</ul>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you find any glitches, bugs or have any \nother suggestions, please let us know.

It seamlessly integrates into [Sodium][sodium]'s video settings which allow you to configure the quality of bubble columns independently of the main graphics profile.\n\n> Note: Without [Sodium][sodium] installed, **Blocky Bubbles** will use the main graphics quality setting.\n\nI have also obtained permission from miniluv73, the original artist behind the fast bubbles textures for the Bedrock Edition version of [Faithful 32x][faithful], to use his assets inside an in-built resource pack! Simply head to the resource pack menu to upscale **Blocky Bubbles** to double resolution.\n***\n\n### Getting Started\n**Blocky Bubbles** operates on [Kikugie's fork of Stonecutter][stonecutter-kt], allowing for easy multi-version scheming. Every release will be available for most versions since 1.17, allowing you to get the full experience regardless of your circumstances.\n\n- Make sure you're running a Fabric instance of the game. If you're playing from the vanilla launcher, follow the [Fabric installation guide][fabric-guide]. If you're playing from a third-party launcher like [Prism][prism], you'll need to follow their own instructions which you can often find on their respective websites. For example, [here][prism-guide] is Prism's guide to downloading mods.\n- If you're not using a third-party launcher with in-built mod installation, you'll need to download the latest version of **Blocky Bubbles** for your game version from the [GitHub releases][github-releases] page or on [Modrinth][modrinth-versions]. Drag the `.jar` file into your mods folder and launch the game!\n\n> Important: **Blocky Bubbles** requires [Fabric API][fabric-api]. Without it, the game will fail to start!\n\n[fabric]: https://fabricmc.net\n[fabric-installer]: https://fabricmc.net/use/installer\n[fabric-guide]: https://docs.fabricmc.net/players/installing-fabric\n[fabric-api]: https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api\n[prism]: https://prismlauncher.org\n[prism-guide]: https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/download-mods\n[modrinth-versions]: https://modrinth.com/mod/blocky-bubbles/versions\n[github-releases]: https://github.com/axialeaa/BlockyBubbles/releases\n[stonecutter-kt]: https://github.com/kikugie/stonecutter-kt\n[sodium]: https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium\n[faithful]: https://faithfulpack.net","published":"2023-11-18T19:12:15.184347Z","updated":"2024-05-12T19:34:01.719913Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":55198,"followers":42,"categories":["cursed","optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["AvADRRpa","BsVoE9CR","yv6IvN0c","YjnTebMY","4qWV0nqk","K0mYtrrI","Ieb53ngP","N1d91WtC","hmC6PLBO","3DMebV1d","QucbNi1L"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/9pubtjcn/7c702ddf0204753f221ab781f3f9360e071b988b.png"},"version":{"id":"AvADRRpa","project_id":"9pubtjcn","author_id":"qt5SjxUE","featured":false,"name":"Blocky Bubbles 1.0.0 (1.20.1-2)","version_number":"1.0.0","changelog":"Welcome to the first release of Blocky Bubbles!

Most animated block entity models will only render when absolutely necessary. <br/><br/>\n**Can I use it with Sodium?** Yes you can, but for this you are **required** to install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium) as well. <br/><br/> \nRequires [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)\n<br/><br/>\n\n\n## FAQ and Help\n\n**Q: I need help with the mod/need to report a bug!** <br/>\n**A:** If you're having trouble setting up the mod or using it alongside other mods, I'd recommend you join our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9) and ask for help there. *If the issue is a BUG* please report it on our issue tracker (\"Issues\" tab at the top of the page)<br/><br/>\n\n**Q: Does this mod glitch the chest animation or turn chests invisible?**\n**A:** This bug has been completely eradicated in EBE versions 0.5 and above. If the issue still persists (it shouldn't), leave an issue on GitHub or join the [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7Aw3y4RtY9). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: My chests are still invisible!** <br/>\n**A:** You're likely using a Sodium version lower than 0.5, which doesn't support certain Fabric Rendering features by default. If you need to use a Sodium version lower than 0.5 with EBE, you should install [Indium](https://modrinth.com/mod/indium). <br/><br/>\n\n**Q: How is this different from [FastChest](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fastchest)?** <br/>\n**A:** FastChest does not preserve chest animations, and only optimizes chests (in a similar way to EBE). EBE also optimizes other block entities:\n- Ender Chests\n- Signs\n- Bells\n- Beds\n- Shulker Boxes\n<br/><br/>\n\n## FPS Boost\nRendering 1700 chests:\n### Vanilla\n![Before](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/before.png)\n### With EBE\n![After](https://github.com/FoundationGames/EnhancedBlockEntities/raw/116_indev/img/after.png) <br/>\nA 155% frame rate increase!\n\n## Resource Packs\nHere's an example of how you can customize chests with resource packs using EBE. <br/><br/>\n![Custom Chest GIF](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55095883/112942134-f67fe780-912f-11eb-8b11-cf316544c22b.gif)","published":"2021-03-01T00:33:17.073472Z","updated":"2023-11-26T00:58:42.011781Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2235453,"followers":3132,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["tUbREtJR","J7Zc989q","l4eXcVcY","oiMCXKDH","HHqDCd5p","bndJ1Eq5","Zl4ETunR","ILuyoK6c","qbUAJjs9","VOB3iJkd","5FTTHyNq","88qNYjJz","Id00LoSl","s76PBY7D","fZx04xgT","6NvQpIBY","fJLBqbZ5","Xdo5ZiRc","i3v1Skck","eIFo7wvq"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"i3v1Skck","project_id":"OVuFYfre","author_id":"WH9NfS5R","featured":true,"name":"EBE v0.9 for 1.20.1, 1.20","version_number":"0.9+1.20","changelog":"- Update to 1.20(.1)\n- Enhanced decorated pots","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-26T05:15:05.839603Z","downloads":1046547,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"7e8b402fd25efd396bc7f0f25a663808ae9890accc227850c454dfcdc975657f22afceb15878e781485622434a6f6d60aff2a60264aa4425edd52ebe052a0de5","sha1":"61cfe50f69f8ef9e3640c0269ef158870f5b0410"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/OVuFYfre/versions/i3v1Skck/enhancedblockentities-0.9%2B1.20.jar","filename":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":490690,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"FLGCXPFi","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"O79BATDr","user":{"id":"WH9NfS5R","username":"FoundationGames","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/43485105?v=4","bio":"download my mod please","created":"2020-10-24T21:26:35.640180Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"enhancedblockentities-0.9+1.20.jar"},"mods\\[前置] ForgeConfigAPIPort-v8.0.0-1.20.1-Fabric.jar":{"sha512":"257cd85263ab5119ce78cf16f2e7fdaf8b350e526c758d00f0af8393b9fabd581a2a974096fc7c7af45d793660e2e7b84391e11d10522036759ec66220a4b616","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"ohNO6lps","slug":"forge-config-api-port","project_type":"mod","team":"Lcr15WUK","title":"Forge Config API Port","description":"NeoForge's & Forge's config systems provided to other modding ecosystems.

The horse/donky/mule must be **Tamed by yourself**.\n2. It should be within 128 blocks, otherwise it cannot hear your whistle.(This can be configured for versions after 1.0.1）\n3. It cannot be leashed or being ridden.\n4. Added new item:Ender horse armor.\nIf your horse is equipped with ender horse armor，you can:\n1.Call your horse anytime, anywhere\n2.If your horse dies, you can still bring it back to life\n\n**One more thing!**\nWe added a new feature: **Spur**! When you are riding, press H to spur your horse on. It will get a little injured, but it will speed up for a while! Even more, there are two levels of spur-speed, meaning that you can spur it twice to make it run even faster.\n\n**Credit**\n- Thank [Kltyton](https://modrinth.com/user/kltyton) for solving the UUID problem, adding the new teleport mechanic, and optimizing the codes!! \n\n## 版权声明|License\n- **作者保留该作品的所有权利。禁止在其他社交平台（包括群聊、网盘等）重新上传或商用，否则后果自负。** This content is All Rights Reserved, meaning that you cannot redistribute/modify & distribute this content, or use it in commercial ways. \n\n- **欢迎您将其收录到整合包中或用其制作视频，请在简介处附上此发布页面的链接和[我的bilibili主页](https://space.bilibili.com/190900020)，也欢迎在简介艾特我，我很想看你们的视频！**\nIf you make a video about this content or put this content in your modpack, please give credit and link to this page, and I would love to know!

Copper Golems\n\n    What's the good of a copper button if you don't have a copper golem as well? Copper golems are friendly little creatures that the player can build for themselves! Just place down any regular copper block with a lightning rod on top and copper button in front, then give that button a smack and WHAM! You got yourself a little ~minion~ buddy to accompany you on your adventure.\n\n   Copper Golems will wander randomly, pressing any copper buttons they find until they eventually oxidize into statues (oh my!). You can also give them an item and they will diligently go around finding something to use that item on, like the good little ~~minion~~ helper they are!\n\n   Watch our for cats, though, because if a copper golem finds a cat, well...

Another Config Lib, like, what were you expecting?\n  \n[![](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/08bbd3ff-5c0d-4480-8738-de0f070a04dd.png)](https://bisecthosting.com/xander)\n\n## Why does this mod even exist?\n\nThis mod was made to fill a hole in this area of Fabric modding. The existing main config libraries don't achieve what I want from them:\n\n- **[Cloth Config API](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config)**: **It's stale.** The developer of cloth has clarified that they are likely not going to add any more features. They don't want to touch it. ([citation](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206530322-3ae46008-5356-468e-9a73-63b859364d4e.png))\n- **[SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI)**: **It isn't designed for configuration.** In this essence the design feels cluttered. Further details available in [this issue](https://github.com/isXander/Zoomify/issues/85).\n- **[MidnightLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightlib)**: **It has cosmetics among other utilities.** It may not be large but some players (including me) wouldn't want cosmetics out of nowhere.\n- **[OwoLib](https://modrinth.com/mod/owo-lib)**: **It's content focused.** It does a lot of other things as well as config, adding to the size.\n\nAs you can see, there's sadly a drawback with all of them and this is where YetAnotherConfigLib comes in.\n\n## How is YACL better?\n\nYACL has the favour of hindsight. Whilst developing this fresh library, I can make sure that it does everything right:\n\n- **Easy API.** YACL takes inspiration from [Sodium's](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) internal configuration library.\n- **It's styled to fit in Minecraft.** YACL's GUI is designed to fit right in.\n\n## Usage\n\n[The wiki](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib/wiki/Usage) contains a full documentation on how to use YACL.\n\n## Screenshots\n\n<center><div align=\"center\">\n\n![java_A3zdbksGkC](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/43245524/206924832-293b0780-2a8c-4b09-8765-155318d09ed9.png)\n\n</div></center>\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU Lesser General Public License, v3.0](LICENSE).\n","published":"2022-09-02T11:05:20.777780Z","updated":"2024-05-27T14:31:00.360011Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":4189444,"followers":2463,"categories":["library","management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","22w42a","1.19.3","23w05a","23w06a","1.19.4-pre1","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20-pre2","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WRaSIAfC","9TFyuVJN","DM1biniZ","iYzpWd2Z","Af0BJTus","6Fl6Ilzn","RsiSJn8g","4M515h9Z","Op8HYd0I","knEInTQd","2To1GHMW","zngBEiw5","JLCAxM5G","FKVJYGyf","hbt0DzsC","FxNs8Edj","EyhlJvkj","VdIvtIwz","mW3CVg5N","UIAaWmvd","wibQ6TRj","GkKQsCJ6","3EWbdCzX","bIVYcRpm","eQtAB8nC","TWgoDEtx","TXnYvmpI","RmZvIqeu","A04AftxZ","RLTQViRg","51iCmuDG","sj4aPwnQ","NZpUvhBc","nMuzsoQt","M5iKxVFU","VHMFG82e","6EBKvxyG","qHhZ3Mlp","CSXeGyWW","zRlTTWFK","yShEHkWR","kr3UvTk4","jZFsc9tg","oIlFdLZI","8WHpxnmg","SiEAKMh4","gfyPkvYv","Vc0cNGqC","uRw9Zalc","HOxWjhyo","9ACWUOXp","wa9YGZhd","ZqWkEgYo","zoMzOEbl","LM15Ky9N","vASIPGay","zJ1Wh6pM","DjwHtlVp","omClzsLe","zU7Ejh24","g38uL3ti","3vGF9MOJ","SqpDFYpa","M1u6F79I","3HHSMwA9","IsGTmmrV","CgwTUAR2","RPlKFmas","VPm1SrE4","RpevhOax","gJ6ZmZ4Z","Jf2pciI1","HM9McfrA","O7kIps9X","RBAUxw9P","4EU2xyVo","u6jV7Q7R","lVQpbXSe","3hsIB5yP","smEdHeFU","vede4iWJ","n8X2J9Hh","ZytICJS4","IHHNzQkV","3TfeWIWo","cwavYrLH","vMzBhYIk","StXMrAsz","5Y3n1Apc","DretS191","WdbHS4uT","elFOHmh9","R7WWpY0Z","G8Aq3OEv","WTCAdLsq","MJUxq3kq","LXUa8bFw","h61Z2iVZ","dLAG06tP","CL7AHQsm","HHrwznjQ","XNQUud9H","rsM9VY0D","bovSU7Mt","EkAJiIZH","lALu7fvN","TD5Fv92S","ePcFYsKB","hf7D9v77","8DXWiiaq","mkXoQQMn","ZHFdxhFP","hCwZI62j","sDwfolBP","G2PcCpZl","3jH5u49m","RXrT2ogA"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1eAoo2KR/1e43d5714f87ac6b20622e73b3ba7209be5ebafb.png"},"version":{"id":"3hsIB5yP","project_id":"1eAoo2KR","author_id":"nyx2i4fB","featured":false,"name":"3.2.1+1.20 (Fabric)","version_number":"3.2.1+1.20-fabric","changelog":"# YetAnotherConfigLib 3.2.1 for 1.20.1-0\n\n## Changes\n\n### Config API\n\n- Added `ConfigClassHandler#save` and `ConfigClassHandler#load` and deprecated `ConfigClassHandler#serializer`.\n  - The serializer should now never be called directly.\n  - New load method tells serializer to load into a new instance of the config class.

outside, extremely dark...\nYou can't see a lot in the darkness, you wish you had a torch,\nor a lantern to hold and see in the light...\n\nAnd this is now possible with this mod as it adds dynamic lights to the game.\nYou can see in the darkness thanks to your torch now!\n\nThis mod adds dynamic lights to Minecraft. Dynamic lights are lights created by an entity holding an\nitem which makes light as a block, or created by an entity on fire, etc.\n\n[Trailer](https://www.youtube.com/embed/r8r1TNG45tM?wmode=transparent)\n\nSearching other mods to replace OptiFine? [Check out this list!](https://optifine.alternatives.lambdaurora.dev/)\n\n## ✅ Features:\n\n- Dynamic lights.\n- Settings to select how smooth the dynamic lighting is.\n- Works with some modded items.\n- Any entity holding an item which emits light will emit light!\n- Magma cubes emit light.\n- Spectral arrows emit light.\n- Burning entities emit light.\n- Blazes emit light.\n- Some items like torches, soul torches, etc. will not light up in water.\n- Quick and simple API for developers.\n- And more!\n\n## Screenshots\n\n### Items emit light\n\nDropped items which already emit light as a block, will also dynamically emit light!\n\n![Torch](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/21/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Held items emit light\n\nLight is emitted when entities hold light emitting items.\n\n![Fox holding lantern](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/22/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Fire! Fire! Fire!\n\nAny entity on fire will emit light!\n\n![Skeleton on fire!](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/23/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Spectral arrows\n\nSpectral arrows will emit a very weak light!\n\n![Spectral arrows](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/25/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Different luminance!\n\nLight emitted from items depend on the light emitted from their respective blocks!\n\n![light levels](https://media.forgecdn.net/attachments/301/26/2020-07-04_22.png)\n\n### Configuration GUI\n\nAs of v2.1.0.\n\n![Configuration GUI](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_main.png)\n![Entities Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/1.19/images/settings_entities.png)\n\n## 📖 Usage\n\nUsing this mod is very simple!\n\nInstall it in your mods folder along with [Fabric API] and [ModMenu], (and [Sodium] if wanted for better performances).\n\nYou will notice nothing at first but if you go into the video options or into the settings screen of the mod via [ModMenu], you will notice an option called Dynamic Lights which is by default off, choose the wanted configuration and enjoy!\nYou can also configure the mod by editing the file in `config/lambdynlights.toml`.\n\nNeed help? Come check out [my Discord server][LambdAurora Discord].\n\n\n\n## 📖 How does it work internally?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/HOW_DOES_IT_WORK.md).\n\n## 📖 Is there an API? How to use it as a developer?\n\nCheck [this documentation](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/blob/1.17/API.md).\n\n# 📖 Compatibility\n\n- [Sodium] is recommended for better performances.\n- [Canvas] is compatible but still WIP: expect huge lag spike with it until a proper lighting API is done in Canvas.\n- **OptiFabric is obviously incompatible.**\n\n\n**<p

library mod for client-side mods. Contains most of the common/shared code of masa's client mods, and adds some inter-operation support between the dependent mods.","body":"# Description\n\nMaLiLib is a library mod for client-side mods, containing most of the shared code between the dependent mods.\nFor example it contains all the configuration options and serialization, a powerful keybind system, most of the Screen/GUI code and a bunch of other miscellaneous utility classes and methods for the mods that are built around MaLiLib.\n\n(The name is short for `masa's Litemod Library` because I have zero imagination...\nThe mod was initially created for the 1.12.x LiteLoader versions of masa's client mods.)\n\n## Mods that require MaLiLib\n\nMaLiLib is required by all of [masa's](https://modrinth.com/user/masa) client-side mods, starting from the indicated versions:\n* [Item Scroller](https://modrinth.com/mod/item-scroller/) - 0.14.0 and later\n* [Litematica](https://modrinth.com/mod/litematica/) - for any builds starting from around 2018-06-11\n* [MiniHUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/minihud/) - 0.17.0 and later\n* [TellMe](https://modrinth.com/mod/tellme/) - 0.6.1 and later\n* [Tweakeroo](https://modrinth.com/mod/tweakeroo/) - 0.8.0 and later\n\nThere are also a number of other client-side mods by other authors that are built around MaLiLib. The mod project/description usually indicates which mod(s) are required as a dependency.\n\n## Mod Versions\n\n**Make sure to download the correct mod version for your Minecraft version and mod loader from the Versions page!!**\n\n**Note:** There are both Fabric and Forge versions of the mod! Look at the tagged mod loader or the file name to get the correct version of the mod for your mod loader!\n\nThe file name always indicates the mod loader (for example Fabric vs. Forge) and the Minecraft version.\nThe file name is in the format:\n`malilib-<mod loader>-<MC version>-<mod version>.jar`\n\nFor example:\n`malilib-fabric-1.19.2-0.13.0.jar`\n\nThe required version of malilib for each mod version *may be* indicated in the changelog of each of the dependent mods.  But basically you want to get the version of all the mods that were the latest released version at the given time, to avoid version mismatches.\n\nThis would mostly become more tricky to figure out if you for some reason want to use certain older mod versions than the latest available version for a given MC version. Especially the 0.9.x and 0.10.x version era of MaLiLib for MC 1.12.2 and 1.14.x and 1.15.x (and maybe also 1.16.x still?) were kinda volatile for version compatibility. Also the releases based on the code rewrites, starting from MaLiLib 0.50.0 and going until the eventual 1.0.0 release change lots of things between versions, so getting all the mods from the same release date is

By default you can stop the spread by placing four coal blocks within the portal's radius. This can however be changed in the config. Players around the portal will receive a message when the spread effect begins and when it is prevented.<br><br>The mod saves all portal locations to '<em>../world-folder/data/netherportalspread/portals/</em>'. A new portal is detected when it's created or when a player goes from the nether to the overworld. So for old worlds you'll have to go through it and back once to start the spread effect, or re-fire the portal.

use the old sounds if desired (like in 1.16)\n\nThis mod is client-side, so it does not need to be installed on the server for it to work.\n\nRequires [Fabric

Configure the options, keybinds and server list as you would like them to be shipped in the modpack\n2. Join any world and run \"/defaultoptions saveAll\" to save your current options in the defaultoptions folder (located in the config folder where it should remain)\n3. Do not include the options.txt and servers.dat from the root directory in your modpack\n4. Fresh installations (meaning no existing options.txt) will now start out with your default options\n\n**If you are using FoamFix Anarchy Version**, disable `B:initOptions` in the FoamFix config or else Default Options will not work. See this [GitHub issue](https://github.com/blay09/DefaultOptions/issues/25) for more info.","published":"2022-06-14T21:15:45.532802Z","updated":"2024-06-02T07:12:06.621070Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":293353,"followers":60,"categories":["management","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["J2H2vpLI","YN36x9Jb","nw9yrzag","jJxa5Gmc","HSWQDe7S","LlFwkgUx","9tmOVtry","Pb0E8WZN","Et9oI0rT","QSc3hlWR","aiy49T0Q","o32sAXGh","NdWk53Qq","h2fGLwAL","gUEpxWEe","iuGiPVsP","QIKpMBgZ","CKNINccT","n1N8gK1t","srYLHGmM","wRqU3JuA","64N7yejA","7P1WUDrG","ayHJIZRi","w9xvfauD","HYa1CJIc","E01imSXQ","NqeV4Paq","dKbEPttX","1ND1cFJv","WQuAHNve","fDOyeuYl","NWRiaqeG","R4Z3bOY5","5yhpUFE5","tcduI2FF","YfMiHW38","QT19TeGt","HMv3cEyp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/WEg59z5b/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"QIKpMBgZ","project_id":"WEg59z5b","author_id":"WE4nCeiO","featured":false,"name":"18.0.1+fabric-1.20","version_number":"18.0.1+fabric-1.20","changelog":"-

It works in single-player, and clients connecting to servers with it don't need it installed.\n\n</center>\n\n---\n\n## No Sneaking Over Magma!\n\nInspired as the counterpart to [Sneak Through Berries](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/sneakthroughberries)!\n> ~~Why Mojang lets you sneak on literal magma but not through bushes... idk~~\n\nMojang might, but I don't!\n\nMakes it so that you take damage on magma blocks even while sneaking.\n\nIncludes other options for damaging and setting fire to entities on magma.\n\n---\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Configuration</summary>\n\nConfiguration requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config/files),\nand configuring the mod in-game requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions).\n\n##### Options:\n\n- Sneaking protects from magma (default: false)\n- Frostwalker protects from magma (default: true)\n- Magma damages non-living entities (default: false)\n- Magma sets fire to entities (default: false)\n- Download translation updates (default: true): Download translations from Crowdin when the game launches\n \n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Translating</summary>\n\nIf you'd like to help translate No Sneaking Over Magma, you can do so on [Crowdin](https://crwd.in/no-sneaking-over-magma).\n\nNew translations will be added once approved without the mod needing an update thanks to [CrowdinTranslate](https://github.com/gbl/CrowdinTranslate).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\nThis mod is only for Fabric (works on Quilt, too!) and I won't be porting it to Forge. The license is MIT, however, so anyone else is free to port it.\n\nI'd appreciate links back to this page if you port or otherwise modify this project, but links aren't required.","published":"2021-06-13T23:11:11.070419Z","updated":"2024-05-09T19:58:32.461276Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":117118,"followers":17,"categories":[],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["NfZkEdwT","9JOZuvgM","KzLF0bje","dZZ93z70","N4oMRD32","SNdZpFMC","5mAwYn4Z","Vkn6MiPR","Pu2HJGvz","2yDAUiDl","RKVikHWR","PmR5wc8Q","TLGBjj37","ydnPXZyX","fNMiXy7u","YMTIaaf2"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cqDlVM1w/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"PmR5wc8Q","project_id":"cqDlVM1w","author_id":"LxSEd81o","featured":false,"name":"1.0.18+MC1.20-1.20.1","version_number":"1.0.18+MC1.20-1.20.1","changelog":" Updated for 1.20 and 1.20.1!\n\nA cumulative changelog can be found [here](https://gitlab.com/supersaiyansubtlety/no_sneaking_over_magma/-/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md)","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-14T23:50:22.818756Z","downloads":41680,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"958f74219f7e36b683607f4c0f1cbca9823138a9","sha512":"a247c9ea454b8f495e3e8699288c661e1fd80168c202b0e1ca2816e99e7707584c68f1d72b157bb7df1d0bb8a2ca7b6a14b1ed6a2fac25f2da70b428b31e9923"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/cqDlVM1w/versions/PmR5wc8Q/no-sneaking-over-magma-1.0.18%2BMC1.20-1.20.1.jar","filename":"no-sneaking-over-magma-1.0.18+MC1.20-1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":70852,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"s7VTKfLA","project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"eTCL1uh8","project_id":"mOgUt4GM","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"optional"},{"version_id":"XheZ9iGK","project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"by1ddEWK","user":{"id":"LxSEd81o","username":"supersaiyansubtlety","name":"Will","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/618276?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-12-14T17:10:51.649412Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"no-sneaking-over-magma-1.0.18+MC1.20-1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\chicken-nerf-1.0.18+MC1.20-1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"b66d0d14a3ff72ad2bed48dc3cd8b1e5597afccd40ae50295296005c33cd720a0ff34a8ce623f723ea0beb72f3d7e87b41bc3a1e0ef46e797bfbaaf50c7cc1c7","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"KoP5DUTS","slug":"chicken-nerf","project_type":"mod","team":"OzrUnREf","title":"Chicken Nerf","description":"Prevents random chicken egg laying.

it to connect to servers that have it. It also works in singleplayer.\n\n</center>\n\n---\nEver think \"Chicken farms are too easy...\", or \"Getting food in Minecraft isn't a challenge anymore...\"?\n\nWell, this mod can help you with that. \n\nChickens will no longer randomly lay eggs. \nInstead, when you breed two chicken (with seed like in vanilla), they will produce a random number of eggs. \n\nYou can see the mod showcased at [2:00 of this video](https://youtu.be/x0R2ubLZEVE?t=120) by [bstylia14](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnVYbd8Kzp442CjJrkWLUKQ/videos).\n\nThis has several advantages:\n- it makes more sense\n- it makes chicken farms non-trivial\n- it can reduce lag because wild chickens won't randomly create items all over the place\n- it more closely matches the other animals of minecraft\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Configuration</summary>\n\nConfiguration requires [Cloth Config](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config/files),\nand configuring the mod in-game requires [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu/versions).\n\nThe default settings will result in about one baby chicken each time you breed two chickens.\n\n##### Options:\n\n- Minimum eggs chickens lay, default 1\n- Maximum eggs chickens lay, default 3\n- Average chickens from one egg, default 0.3333\n- Enable translation fetching, default true\n\n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Mod Integrations</summary>\nSome entities from these mods will have their breeding behavior changed similarly to how Chicken Nerf affects chickens. \n\n- [Better Animals Plus](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/betteranimalsplus), affected entities:\n  - Geese\n  - Pheasants\n  - Turkeys\n    \n</details>\n\n<br/>\n\n<details>\n\n<summary>Translating</summary>\n\nIf you'd like to help translate Chicken Nerf, you can do so on [Crowdin](https://crwd.in/chicken-nerf).\n\nNew translations will be added once approved without the mod needing an update thanks to [CrowdinTranslate](https://github.com/gbl/CrowdinTranslate).\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\nThis mod is only for Fabric (works on Quilt, too!) and I won't be porting it to Forge.

If you want more OptiFine features on Fabric, you can either check [this list](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives), made by LambdaAurora, **or** you can use the [Fabulously Optimized modpack](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), which includes **all** the OptiFine parity mods!\n\n### Featuring:\n\n- [🎲](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/RANDOM_GUIDE.md) Custom & random entity textures with the OptiFine format, including even more properties!\n- [💡](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/EMISSIVE_GUIDE.md) Emissive/glowing entity textures with the OptiFine format\n- [😑️](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README.md#-blinking-textures) Blinking mobs\n- [🎨](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/.github/README-assets/SKIN_GUIDE.md) Player skin features\n\n## Compatibility\n\n- OptiFine's random/custom or emissive entity resource packs - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatable**\n- [Entity Model Features (EMF)](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [dorianpb's CEM mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**\n- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\">  **Fully compatible**\n- [Iris Shaders](https://modrinth.com/mod/iris) - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Fully compatible**<br />(Support varies depending on the shader)\n- Mod added entities - <img src=\"https://emojipedia-us.s3.amazonaws.com/source/skype/289/check-mark-button_2705.png\" alt=\"✅\" width=\"15\"> **Compatible**<br />(Only if the mod creator used the vanilla rendering code to render their mobs)\n\n## Settings & configuration\n\n- Settings can be changed in-game using [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu), the settings button in the resource pack screen, or  by editing the config file, located under `config/entity_texture_features.json`\n- A few of these options can also be changed via the [Puzzle mod](https://modrinth.com/mod/puzzle)\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/raw/master/.github/README-assets/options.png\" alt=\"Options\" width=\"450\">\n\n## Mod support\n\n- This mod should be compatible with any mod added entities as long as they extend `LivingEntityRenderer` class for rendering and utilise it correctly\n- Any mod displaying an entity in a custom GUI can force the default texture by having the `entity.getblockstate` set to either `null` or of type `VOID_AIR`, the same can be achieved by settings the display mob's UUID to `UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes((\"GENERIC\").getBytes())`. \n\n## FAQ\n\n My entities are invisible/broken!\n\n> Custom Entity Models is not a feature provided by ETF. If your entities are invisible or look corrupted you'll need to instal my other mod [Entity Model Features EMF](https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features) as well (this includes resource packs such as Fresh Animations). Keep in mind that the CEM mod is still in alpha development and may still occur issues.\n\n Blocks and items are not emissive!\n\n> ETF does not support emissive block and item texture, for that you'll need to install [Continuity](https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity).\n\n My game is lagging, help!\n\n> If you are experiencing lag please check your most recent log file to see if any errors are being logged, sometimes an incorrectly written properties file or missing textures may lag the system.\n\n It doesn't work!\n\n> Check if any issues are not actually a problem in the properties file, a few packs seem to be pointing to a texture that doesn't exist.\n So far all mob entities support random & emissive textures, but there may still be some quirks. If you find bugs you can either [report them in GitHub](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/issues/new?assignees=Traben-0&labels=bug&template=bug_report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D+%22short+issue+description%22) or get support in the Discord server (linked on the top of the page).\n\n> Emissives are broken with Complimentary shaders, what do I do?\n\n>Complementary shaders has its own in-built emissive textures that usually work fine but will conflict with some resource packs. You can either disable Complimentary's emissives or ETF's emissives to fix this.\n\n My question isn't here!\n\n> Feel free to check ETF's [Discord](https://discord.gg/invite/rURmwrzUcz) to ask your questions or check the FAQ there :)\n\n## Change log\n\n [Changelog](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Texture_Features/blob/master/common/CHANGELOG.md).\n\n## License\n\nThis mod is under the [GNU

Attempt Parkour","description":"Gives certain mobs the ability to jump over things","body":"## Description\n\n**This mod gives some mobs a simple jumping ai that allows them to jump over obstacles and gaps in their way.**\n\n - The mobs that currently have the jumping ability are Zombies, Zombie\n   Villagers, Zombified Piglins, Silverfish, Endermites, Endermen,\n   Wither Skeletons, Skeletons, Spiders, Cave Spiders, Illagers,\n   Witches, Iron Golems, and Creepers.\n   \n - The AI attempts to be realistic to vanilla jumping, which means that\n  slow mobs can't jump very far. (Zombies can only jump one block for\n  example).\n\n## Limitations\nThe ai does not do additional pathfinding, so it can't calculate a complicated series of jumps. Also, the ai starts to fail under very fast mob speeds or high jumps.\n\n## Configuration\nThe config file uses JSON. Add a mob by listing its id, and a priority. You can find mob ids by using the /summon command - the list of arguments will be a list of mob ids. The priority is a bit jenky. It represents what priority the AI has over other AIs. A lower value means that the jumping AI probably won't be overridden, but it might override other AI's.

This can free up your computer's processor to focus on other tasks, resulting in **improved frame rates and increased responsiveness**. \n\n\n<br>\n\n\nThe strict goal of maintaining exact behavior with vanilla makes Lithium suitable for almost any Minecraft server running Fabric, even for highly complex gameplay scenarios and creations. In fact, our continued insistence towards not changing vanilla gameplay has even led to the mod being officially allowed in [Minecraft speedrunning](https://www.speedrun.com/mc).\n\n<br>\n\n## Installation\n\nMake sure you have the latest version of Fabric Loader present and then simply drop the mod into your mods folder. No other mods or additional setup (not even Fabric API!) is required. You do not need to create new worlds in order to take advantage of the mod.\n\n<br>\n\n\nWhile you're at it, you may want to check out two of my other mods, [Phosphor](https://modrinth.com/mod/phosphor) and [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium), as they're both fully compatible and only help to further improve performance in different parts of the game.\n\n<br>\n\n## Configuration\n\nLithium makes use of an semi-unusual configuration system which allows you to enable or completely disable patches the mod applies. This system allows fine-grained control over what code in Minecraft is modified by Lithium, and as such, can be used to completely eliminate bugs or mod incompatibilities introduced by the mod.\n\n<br>\n\nFor more information, please read [the wiki entry](https://github.com/jellysquid3/lithium-fabric/wiki/Configuration-File) on modifying your configuration file.\n\n<br>\n\nPlease note: An empty configuration file is *perfectly normal* and just means you want to use the default options, which are already set up out of the box for the best performance the mod can offer.\n\n<br>\n\n## Reporting Issues\n\nPlease use the issue tracker linked at the top of the page to report bugs, crashes, and other issues.\n\n","published":"2021-01-03T00:56:52.292581Z","updated":"2024-04-29T20:44:11.845709Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":6640599,"followers":9394,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["EhG1mQzx","5fmGl08Y","ouTdXXWj","igqdFUYG","pGhOMdTm","Le0tKjFX","rvsW1zhb","7jxErppe","aZ0JFf08","cTZv31gu","nVR7Q63z","FHFKMKeu","2w527DB2","2CbyxeU0","2aoHIXuK","Ehsd7YUl","MoF1cn6g","pHl1Vi6k","pXdccFQf","sIKhU9s4","ZRR9yqHD","Zs3sdHjK","Nba2vozh","2ysRxhIL","ySBrfN8N","xVm1caOt","IQxlSIiw","FXG2XqRP","ALnv7Npy","OKrb9xMn","3Gq9H7R9","7scJ9RTg","XS6vJwop","sMWkk4VU","GYl3zwgt","m6sVgAi6","53cwYYb1","14hWYkog","2KMrj5c1","ZSNsJrPI","qdzL5Hkg","WzQmxYRa","nMhjKWVE","tDFVQpHO","bAbb09VF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/gvQqBUqZ/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"ZSNsJrPI","project_id":"gvQqBUqZ","author_id":"uhPSqlnd","featured":false,"name":"Lithium

**Description**\nIn Minecraft there's Soul Fire, yet if you or a mob catch fire because of it nothing will change from normal fire.  \nThis mod makes Soul Fire actually work as one would expect, all whilst providing an *easy-to-use* API for modders that want to add their own custom fire and have it behave consistently.\n\n## **Features**\n- **Soul Fire overlay**  \n![Overlay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/soul-fire-d/overlay.gif)\n- **Entities catching fire from Soul Fire will burn with actual Soul Fire.**  \nBurning from Soul Fire will deal 2 damage per second.  \n![Sheep](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/soul-fire-d/sheep.gif)\n- **Actually consistent Soul Fire behavior.**  \nFor instance, but not limited to, zombies burning from Soul Fire and arrows passing through Soul Fire can set their targets on Soul Fire.  \n![Arrows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/soul-fire-d/arrow.gif)\n- **Two new enchantments: Soul Fire Aspect and Soul Flame.**  \nAs their name suggests, they work exactly the same as Fire Aspect and Flame with the only difference being the kind of fire the target will burn from, with the consequent damage increase.  \nBoth these enchantments can be highly configured individually, enabling (default) or disabling them and more.  \n- **API for custom fire types:**  \nFor mod/datapack creators who want to add their own custom fire(s), or implement another mod's fire, this mod provides an *easy-to-use* API to register your fire(s) and have it(them) behave consistently **automatically**.  \nFurthermore for each new fire registered using this API there can be new custom Fire Aspect and Flame enchantments available in game **automatically**.  \nSee the bottom section *For developers* to know more.\n\n## **Dependencies**\n| Mod | Loader | Requirement |\n| :-: | :----: | :---------: |\n| [Forge Config API Port](https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-api-port) | Fabric | Required |\n\n## **License and right of use**\nFeel free to use this mod for any

Requires <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/connector\">Connector</a> and <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/forgified-fabric-api\">FFAPI</a> on forge.<br/>\n<i>Colloquially: Tinkerer's Atlas / antique-atlas</i>\n</center>\n\n---\n\nPress **[M]** at any time to bring up the world map.\n\nDrag the map to pan, scroll to zoom, and use the bookmark buttons to create, remove, or hide waypoints.\n\n### Basic Features\n\n- The map is rendered using hand-drawn \"tiles\" representing terrain, biomes, and structures.\n- At their smallest, tiles represent an entire chunk - no peeking for resources or player bases!\n- Totally server-optional - installing AA (or just [surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor)) on the server enables structures and sharing.\n- Structures only appear on the map after you've stood in or looked at them in-game:\n\n![structure discovery](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5Ve4Ui4/images/86054c7949fed59341cef60d0d9f27aee86ae6ef.gif)\n\n- Markers for waypoints come in a variety of styles:\n\n![marker styles](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5Ve4Ui4/images/f22a29ce8a00847e5a49d74d4c32f7b076a57692.png)\n\n- Markers are automatically added for notable structures, player graves, and active nether portals:\n\n![structure markers](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5Ve4Ui4/images/190cc4eaa2e8784dd0f46bee9c225228a05f191a.png)\n\n- Map exploration can be shared with `/surveyor share [player]`, also revealing their position on the map:\n\n![map sharing](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5Ve4Ui4/images/4422049c395a856c35bbc361c52e8bcd30e89523.png)\n\n- All of the above is data-driven using resource packs.\n\n#### Stylized Design\n\nAntique Atlas is designed to feel like your own explorer's memory, or a permanent journal.</br>\n\n- You can only see what you've seen before.\n- You can't \"lose\" your map in any way.\n- Flavour text is written subjectively:\n\n![grave style euphemisms](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/Y5Ve4Ui4/images/c6f5e20bcef2c26c40390e888e540dcdd89a1818.png)\n\n#### Don't Play the Map\n\nAntique Atlas is designed to keep your focus on your surroundings, not the map.\n\n- The best view of the world is in-game - not the atlas!\n- The atlas stays on its own easily-accessible screen, no distracting minimap.\n- If you're always using your map as a compass, try [PicoHUD](https://modrinth.com/mod/picohud) as well.\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\nAntique Atlas can be configured from `config/antique-atlas.toml`<br/>\n\n`fullscreen` can be disabled to lock the size of the map screen based on your GUI scale.<br/>\n`mapScale` can be adjusted to change the effective GUI scale of the tiles on the map.<br/>\n`structureMarkers` can be edited to toggle markers for structures - this is automatically populated from the respack.<br/>\n`graveStyle` will change the icon and tooltip for player graves - try each out to suit your pack's aesthetics.<br/>\n\n### Resource Packs\n\n> For more information, check out the [resource pack tutorial](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/wiki/Resource-Packs).\n\nBy default, Antique Atlas will use biome tags to approximate a builtin texture for any modded biomes.\n\nTo improve this, add `namespace/atlas/biome/path.json` with `{ \"parent\": \"minecraft:biome\" }` or [custom texturing](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/atlas/biome/badlands.json).\n\nStructures can be similarly [tiled](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/atlas/structure/piece/jigsaw/single/pillager_outpost/watchtower.json) or [marked](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/minecraft/atlas/structure/type/ocean_monument.json) - provided you're familiar with each type of structure identifier.\n\nTile textures are loaded from `textures/atlas/tile` and use an _autotile_-like format.<br/>\nYou can also add an [mcmeta file](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/antique_atlas/textures/atlas/tile/structure/fortress/nether/nether_fortress_bridge_crossing.png.mcmeta) to adjust which other textures should \"connect\" and vice-versa.\n\n#### Markers\n\nMarker textures are loaded from `textures/atlas/marker` and are 32x32 by default.<br/>\nYou can similarly add an [mcmceta file](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/src/main/resources/assets/antique_atlas/textures/atlas/marker/structure/end_city.png.mcmeta) to adjust size, offsets, and any custom mip levels.<br/>\nTo add a player-placeable marker, put the texture in the `custom/` subfolder.\n\nTo automatically mark a non-structure point of interest, use Surveyor's Landmark API - Like in [Surveystones](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveystones).\n\nTextures for landmark types will be used automatically when named `namespace/textures/atlas/marker/landmark/type/path.png`. \n\n---\n\n### Version History\n\nThis is a loveletter rewrite - we want to revitalize interest in antique atlas, and make it easier for others to maintain and add to.\n\n`0.x` uses arch, keeps the original `antiqueatlas` ID, and should be save/network/API-compatible with [tyra's port](https://modrinth.com/mod/antique-atlas), sans the atlas item.\n\n`1.x` uses fabric, and is API-incompatible with 0.x.\n\n`2.x` uses fabric and [Surveyor](https://modrinth.com/mod/surveyor) - and is save, API, network, and respack-incompatible with older versions.<br/>\nWhen upgrading to 2.x, map exploration and markers will be cleared - downgrade and take notes if needed!<br/>\n\n---\n\n### Afterword\n\nAll mods are built on the work of many others.\n\nThe art for antique atlas was created by [Hunternif](https://github.com/Hunternif) ([DA](https://www.deviantart.com/hunternif)) and [lumiscosity](https://github.com/lumiscosity) ([Neocities](https://lumiscosity.neocities.org/)).<br/>\n[Click here](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/blob/1.20/credits.txt) for detailed art credit.\n\nThis mod is a fourth-gen rewrite, and relies heavily on contributions of many developers and artists before us.<br/>\nWe can't draw autotile to save our lives - feel free to [contribute](https://github.com/sisby-folk/antique-atlas/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Atexturing)!\n\nThis mod is included in [Tinkerer's Quilt Plus](https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt) - our modpack about rediscovering vanilla.\n\nWe're open to suggestions for how to implement stuff better - if you see something wonky and have an idea - let us know.\n\n---\n\n<center>\n<b>Tinkerer's:</b> <a href=\"https://modrinth.com/modpack/tinkerers-quilt\">Quilt</a> -

The Fabric Rendering API is required for many mods that use advanced rendering effects, and is currently not supported by Sodium directly. Indium is based upon the reference implementation Indigo, which is part of Fabric API with source available [here](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/tree/1.17/fabric-renderer-indigo). (licensed Apache 2.0)\n\n# Frequently Asked Questions\n## Which mods require Indium?\nAny mod that uses the Fabric Rendering API will require Indium when used with Sodium. These include: Campanion, Bits and Chisels, LambdaBetterGrass,\nContinuity, Packages, and many more. Some of these mods may function without an implementation of the Fabric Rendering API, but have broken textures and models.\n\n## Does Indium affect performance?\nIndium's impact on performance should be negligible, however mods that use the Fabric Rendering API could themselves impact performance. Indium will not provide a performance benefit over using only Sodium.\n\n## Is Indium a replacement for Sodium?\nNo, Indium is an addon mod for Sodium - you must use both mods together to get Fabric Rendering API support with Sodium's rendering optimisations.\n\n## Do I need Indium if I don't use Sodium?\nNo, Indigo is provided as part of Fabric API as the reference implementation of the Fabric Rendering API. Indigo disables itself when Sodium is installed.\n\n## Is Fabric API required?\nYes. To use Sodium with mods that require the Fabric Rendering API, you need *both* Fabric API to provide the rendering API and Indium to implement the rendering API.\n\n## Will it be merged into Sodium?\nFabric Rendering API support is not currently a priority for the Sodium developers, and will not be explored until Sodium is in a more stable state.\n\n## Which versions of Sodium are supported?\nSodium 0.2.0 or newer is required for all versions of Indium. I support the latest stable versions of Sodium for 1.18 and 1.19.

Turns out, they only generate rarely in desert, swamp, and mangrove swamp biomes. Most players won't ever encounter one throughout their playthroughs.\n\nThis datapack uses Fabric/Forge biome modifiers to allow fossils to generate in any Overworld biome. They aren't too common, but exploring big cave systems will give you a good shot at finding some.\n\nSince this is done on top of vanilla fossil generation, fossils will be around ~70% more common in deserts, swamps, and mangrove swamps compared to other biomes. Similarly, fossils are about 160% more common in the deep dark compared to other biomes.\n\n**Configuration:** If you want to edit the generation frequency of these fossils, make a datapack with the `data/more_fossils/worldgen/placed_feature` folder from the source repository and edit the corresponding json file. The `minecraft:rarity_filter` entry controls the rarity of a feature's generation, where a value of 30 corresponds to a 1 in 30 chance of passing through the filter (and a 29 in 30 chance of generation failing).\n\nYou can also go to `data/more_fossils/tags/worldgen/biome` to edit the tags that determine which biomes a fossil can spawn in.","published":"2023-04-25T06:35:41.999832Z","updated":"2024-04-24T05:47:11.242860Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"required","downloads":59946,"followers":79,"categories":["worldgen"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["datapack","fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["fpPStwTg","18c35Kqe","UaNcBkSt","s8hj7gua","A1WrIDFm","Jc7SXCzy","7vEN6TXd","R7X2UrMs"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/6wSvZKQk/ba828533e51e79b92a9b53dbd0d234d60f0883db.webp"},"version":{"id":"7vEN6TXd","project_id":"6wSvZKQk","author_id":"gBflFHI3","featured":false,"name":"2.0.0 - Mod","version_number":"2.0.0","changelog":"Updates the mod to use Fabric biome modifiers, allowing it to work on Fabric, Forge, and Quilt.\n\nOn Forge, the 1.0.1 Forge datapack has identical behavior, so you can use either.

You can configure it to use either a white- or blacklist and any items affected by that lsit will require you to explicitly pick them up using either a right-click or by sneaking. You can also globally disable auto-pickup in the config to force everyone to explicitly pick up all items.\n\n \n\n - **Item Throwing**: You can throw items by holding down the drop key for a period of time. The longer you hold it, the further you'll throw it. Items which have a damage modifier on them like Sword and Axes will also deal damage when they hit something after being thrown this way.\n\n \n\n - **Client-Only Mode**: You can use Interactic in a mode where it will automatically disable all server-side features and give you only the enhanced rendering and tooltips.\n\n \n\nAll of these features can be individually toggled in the config","published":"2021-08-03T19:06:42.818734Z","updated":"2024-01-11T18:19:01.446075Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":423226,"followers":308,"categories":["utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17","1.17.1","1.18-pre8","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19-pre3","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["xiTAqyPB","kicm7pvf","FlxdQ0Cf","YArmqQMg","7OfiG1Wu","fVMWmsTh","bahB0VI3","D7g1PZ50","gPRyWa8f","WhjBkxuI","KaaebHRh","3ZriHPeX","7LmnFHXo","tj8ZH9jV","kt7gW3fF","BukcqFnZ","M0c0R0nD","PYdrXIcA"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ErpAAAaf/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"BukcqFnZ","project_id":"ErpAAAaf","author_id":"qGOpk8Hs","featured":false,"name":"[1.20+] Interactic - 0.2.0","version_number":"0.2.0+1.20","changelog":"This is a straightforward port to 1.20 - support for older versions will be dropped","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-06-09T17:18:52.520383Z","downloads":219680,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d71b61842b1a6ac7b81c4d2be06ac06b3f128097","sha512":"e76d57376b811a37d9c8b48121f059759783c8c74067c225ccd7172fe263c0a4e93281f98d2dbc356937b1e5e6546ea2fbe3ccc080ace454f77132e261bb6d7c"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/ErpAAAaf/versions/BukcqFnZ/interactic-0.2.0%2B1.20.jar","filename":"interactic-0.2.0+1.20.jar","primary":true,"size":111864,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":"DgIYuFEF","project_id":"ccKDOlHs","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"EOzKiDsm","user":{"id":"qGOpk8Hs","username":"glisco","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/15788224?v=4","bio":"she/her | creative director & tech lead\n@ Wisp Forest (https://github.com/wisp-forest)\n\n","created":"2021-03-13T09:39:29.068275Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"[前置] interactic-0.2.0+1.20.jar"},"mods\\WhatTheBucket-Fabric-1.20.1-11.0.3.jar":{"sha512":"41020359fec29ad848dd844f60a113dee43885e4d9d628a98a3b516a4397ca81424ecc9bb445af50cd75c270b92e3b0341c2d1ba362a1200537f5ef67d7241d7","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"zUxYvzMP","slug":"what-the-bucket","project_type":"mod","team":"xt2mQ5fE","title":"What The Bucket","description":"Fixes some bucket items not leaving an empty bucket behind when used as a recipe ingredient.","body":"This mod fixes an [old bug](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-151457) in Minecraft that causes certain bucket items to be destroyed when using them as ingredients. For example a bucket of water will normally convert into an empty bucket when used as a crafting ingredient however newer buckets such as the bucket of powdered snow will be completely consumed. With this mod installed all affected vanilla buckets will convert into an empty bucket as expected.\n\n## Affected Buckets\n- Bucket of Pufferfish\n- Bucket of Salmon\n- Bucket of Cod\n- Bucket of Tropical Fish\n- Bucket of Axolotl\n- Powder Snow Bucket\n- Bucket of Tadpole\n\n## FaQ\n\n### How does this work with servers?\nWhen this mod is installed on a server the bug will be fixed for all connecting players while on the server even if they do not have the mod installed. If the mod is only installed on the client the bug will only be fixed for single player worlds. It is recommended that client and server install the mod for consistency. \n\n### Will this fix buckets added by mods?\nNo. The issue fixed by this mod only impacts vanilla buckets. If a bucket added by a mod has this issue the author of that mod is responsible for fixing their own bucket code and you should report the issue to them. In rare cases I may consider fixing the bug if the modder is no longer around or the mod is unmaintained however this should only be seen as a last resort.\n\n\n<h2>Credits &amp; Contact</h2>\n<p>Like the mod and want to support me?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Follow me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DarkhaxDev\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a></li>\n<li>Join my <a href=\"https://discord.darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Discord</a></li>\n<li>Check out my <a href=\"https://darkhax.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n[![Nodecraft sponsor banner](https://assets.blamejared.com/nodecraft/darkhax.jpg)](https://nodecraft.com/r/darkhax)\n\n**This project is sponsored by Nodecraft.

You can roll into any direction you are heading (forwards, backwards, sideways, etc...)\n\nThe combat roll ability has 4 seconds cooldown by default.  (Server side configurable)\n\nCooldown of your combat roll ability can be seen on the main UI (aka HUD). (Client side configurable)\n\nExhaust (aka hunger) is added to the player upon rolling (Server side configurable)\n\nRoll ability can only be used when player is: not using item, not jumping, not swimming.\n\n**New!** Now with invulnerability frames! (Disabled by default, can be turned on at `config/combatroll/server.json5`)\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Attributes\n\nThese new entity attributes determine the properties of the combat roll ability.\n\n`combatroll:distance` determines how far the player rolls (the default distance is 3 blocks, server configurable). For example:\n\n`/give @s leather_boots{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:distance\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:3.0, Operation:0,Slot:\"feet\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201178, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:recharge` determines how quickly the cooldown of the roll ability recovers. For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_leggings{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:recharge\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:0.5, Operation:1,Slot:\"legs\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497593, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n`combatroll:count` determines how many times a player can roll before having to wait for recharging (by default a player has 1 roll). For example: \n\n`/give @s leather_helmet{AttributeModifiers:[{AttributeName:\"combatroll:count\", Name:\"testing\", Amount:2, Operation:0,Slot:\"head\",UUID:[I; 66453, 79497594, -201177, -16957605]}]} 1`\n\n&zwnj;\n\n## Enchantments\nImprove various aspects of your combat roll ability with these enchantments.\n\n### Mulit-Roll\nCan be enchanted on helmets - Grants extra rolls (+1 roll / level)\n\n### Acrobat\nCan be enchanted on chests and legs - Increases the recharge speed of the roll cooldown (by +10% / level)\n\n### Longfooted\nCan be enchanted on boots - Increases the distance of your rolls (by 1 block / level).\n\n&zwnj;\n\n# 🔧 Configuration\n\n&zwnj;\n\n### Fabric\n\nClient side settings can be accessed via the [Mod Menu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu).\n\n### Forge\n\nClient side settings can be accessed in Main Menu &gt; Mods &gt; Combat Roll &gt; Config.\n\n### Server\n\n**Server side** configuration can be found in the `config` directory, after running the game with the mod installed.","published":"2022-09-19T17:04:44.140047Z","updated":"2024-04-16T23:08:11.139067Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":435684,"followers":378,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge"],"versions":["qjPNxjeI","QY3g1MPa","6Y4CdZNa","ruVouh8N","fwWMS64D","Ef4UURAJ","cNuQKeYa","bEkfuXFS","azj5HSxy","pGWBRn1i","g54fQTVc","oDqrlOkT","NjDgCyxY","VXixoSQM","UF8erTuU","Ucep0Cu5","VFPcEpGA","KYboqMGf","X1F0kcns","QCPx2IS2","LvVX8D1q","7xq1zpn0","DkP5RdK3","2YI9I4TO","EDsEsJtK","aJk5QhXt","u2ibYGVH","2Ae8EJZw","WOCP3kLf","oSQPSvZH","pzCkMdkj","h13cp5Hk","SzaC8Y3W","JrSJCgLX","qiJtKPOI","kJTOmZiq","4Kt64z82","RkJWufMO","Osxa4mmc","URzpc7Lq","ouVfwhi4","JkgJLz6x","b64nmuue","jsIwSe6h","B7ZtSwe2","iG0xPWUm","vOu5WIvs","bOQ2Cikd","mSQJJvNy","91FfnPM8","UQb9qD3J","XTopJ0Id","deyBZlUs","vaBqHK19","ljjcUkWs","81E06FMa","1QeyH5IG","8Q03X6HA","Aj08MYtw","PSEQMV1l","DYKVvo9P","js1pLjSF","slz81V0J","MzRHyyTC","gLzlXMlf","NP7Nwrwq","vdae5kTA","QiWlD1U9","hJQhKVxj","RBDMFemm","EXGDg1mc","ZFOUucav","tOGQOc87","GKj5mumX","KnHNGyLj","buCwQh9G","LNxSmECr","GmitzqXs","NhqiKzjd","Iu7dNK5J","S9W5W5gZ","n5c0ilso","yr87igvi","soyzSn1W","eVyBNuwl","cIHoyOhg","Btqy2YLV","FwTldg5l","8Zv39qno","jHvKJkv8","rwRYD8bX","ofN9RHSY"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGKYL7st/ec708f6b60ed75fceab14e0848e9906f99dd84e1.png"},"version":{"id":"8Zv39qno","project_id":"wGKYL7st","author_id":"CUHgJfv9","featured":false,"name":"1.3.1+1.20.1","version_number":"1.3.1+1.20.1-fabric","changelog":"# 1.3.1\n\n- Improve roll hotkey handling #40\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-01-14T17:35:28.860451Z","downloads":121754,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"83bc483fdcbc24e6a91544019b9d8705ecf35ff6","sha512":"7eb56def49237fc04a56b13b24ab2fee8b9ec52d081e10a1c8ae61bfab224fb24c9876fe82e6d52fba72da9349aad53134e19f52d24ab35870577da97e0a835a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGKYL7st/versions/8Zv39qno/combatroll-fabric-1.3.1%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"combatroll-fabric-1.3.1+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":190803,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"gedNE4y2","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"oKdlkn0S","user":{"id":"CUHgJfv9","username":"ZsoltMolnarrr","name":"Molnár Zsolt","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/4989469?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2022-07-04T18:48:27.207892Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"rwRYD8bX","project_id":"wGKYL7st","author_id":"CUHgJfv9","featured":false,"name":"1.3.2+1.20.1","version_number":"1.3.2+1.20.1-fabric","changelog":"# 1.3.2\n\n- Fix enabling/disabling enchantments #43, thanks to Mariany P.\n- Improve attribute resolution (Fabric only)\n","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-04-07T10:23:54.372529Z","downloads":19639,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"b399e53b362c5cea4038d6bc4a66285271979c6278d42f150fec798f57a56c58f15b0896e877a83127356f1dfe91f578c56070f798e5dd04f9f9a8c3def86355","sha1":"6b4ebe6bd8693538198450949ac0edb1437740fd"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/wGKYL7st/versions/rwRYD8bX/combatroll-fabric-1.3.2%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"combatroll-fabric-1.3.2+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":191629,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"9s6osm5g","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"},{"version_id":null,"project_id":"gedNE4y2","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"combatroll-fabric-1.3.1+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\[前置] Bookshelf-Fabric-1.20.1-20.1.6.jar":{"sha512":"72e8efdc0f4d1c0ac08502cb10706005f1053516934283871ebb81b47785634f304ce00cb8bb987adaf5ae325243c5649492a1443cdb4eb1ab04c7b4dd7f3d16","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"uy4Cnpcm","slug":"bookshelf-lib","project_type":"mod","team":"qdYl5sw1","title":"Bookshelf","description":"An open source library for other mods!","body":"<p>Bookshelf is a collection of code, frameworks, utilities, and other resources.

This is a library mod, it does not add anything on its own.\n\nI do not recommend other modders to build on this as I will ruthlessly break backwards-compatibility as needed for my mods.\n\nNote that this is not a magic solution for running Forge and Fabric mods together, it's only a library my mods will depend on to make publishing for both versions easier.\n\n## Why is this?\n\nI can't just switch to Fabric and abandon all existing Forge users, but I also don't want to miss a Fabric train if there is one.\n\nTrying a port for fun showed that most of the platform-specific things can easily be hidden away from the actual mod code which doesn't have to care about modloader backends, which should hopefully make it much easier to support both mods at the same time.\n\nThere's other libraries that do the same thing, but given the amount of mods I maintain I don't want to put all my money on one boat only to deal with headaches once those other mods stop being supported.\n\n## How does this?\n\nIt just wraps all platform-specific code behind a unified API (in the simplest way possible, there is no magic involved) and provides superclasses to use in cases where platform-specific methods are added to Vanilla classes.\n\nIt also adds a simple network system (similar to Forge's) and a config layer with sync support.\n\n## Who is this?\n\nHi, I'm Blay and my Twitter is at

This is required for mod configuration, as it allows for using the exact same system as on the Forge mod loader.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/E6BUT4h.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\"

Enough Items](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei/version/12.0.625+fabric) (Recommended)\n\n#### Note: This mod is mostly complete and I will not focus on it as much. However I have not abandoned it and I plan to keep it up to date with the latest major minecraft version.\n\n# Description\n\nThis is a fabric mod that adds a body temperature system based on what biome you are in, the time of day, weather conditions and what blocks are around you. If you get too cold or hot you will start to take damage, but there are ways to maintain a good temperature.\n\n\nIn vanilla minecraft, biomes have there own built in temperature.\nThis mod takes that temperature and determines how cold or hot you should feel.\nSo it should work with any modded biome as long as its biome temperature is set appropriately.\n\n### Heating\nHeat making blocks will slowly increase your temperature if you are less than 3 blocks away.\nTorches increase temperature by 3, fire also 3, lava 8 and campfires 15.\nYou can also increase your temperature by wearing leather armor. Boots increase by 1, leggings 2,  chestplate 3 and helmet 1.\n\nBy putting any piece of leather armor in the crafting table along with wool cloth, you can increase the warmth it provides. You can only do this twice with each armor piece.\n\n### Cooling\nCold making blocks do the opposite of heat making blocks and cool you down but within a shorter range (2 blocks). Ice decreases by 1, packed ice decreases by 3 and blue ice decreases by 6. This is useful if you are in a hot climate since you can just put some ice under your floor and that will cool you down, or in the nether if you don't have fire resistance.\n\nYou will also become colder if it rains, snows, its nighttime or if you get in water.\nThe fire protection enchantment will cool you down 0.5 per level and fire resistance will stop you from taking any damage from high temperature. So if you are too hot drink fire resistance or make ice juice. (use [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei/version/12.0.625+fabric) to see ice juice recipe). Ice juice is very useful in the nether before you get fire resistance or fire protection.\n\n### Wind\nWhen it is windy you will see particles showing the direction the wind is flowing. Being exposed to the wind will cool you down. It will get more windy the higher up you are.\n\n### Ice Box Mechanics\nThe ice box is a new block added that can be used to get ice easier before getting silk touch. First craft an empty ice box (use [REI](https://modrinth.com/mod/rei/version/12.0.625+fabric) for recipe). Then you can right click it with a water bottle to fill it with water. For it to make ice it needs to be in a cold or frigid climate (taiga biomes and snowy biomes will be fine). When you have filled it and it is in a cold or frigid climate you just have to wait and it will freeze. Once it has frozen you can right click it and it will give you 3 ice and turn back into an empty ice box.\n\nWhen it is in a frozen state it will act like packed ice and cool you down by 3 if you are near enough. But it will slowly melt and turn back into its unfrozen state in biomes than are not cold or frigid. The hotter the biome the faster it melts.\n\n### Brick Fireplace Mechanics\nThe brick fireplace block, when lit, will heat you up by 16 in a large radius. You can light it by right clicking it with fuel items. Coal and charcoal fuel it for 60 seconds, coal blocks 540 seconds and sticks 5 seconds.\n\nPutting brick walls, cobblestone walls or stone brick walls above the fireplace cause the smoke it makes to come out above the walls like a chimney.\n\n### Temperature Display and Thermometer\nThe temperature display is a thermometer in the center of your hotbar. It will start turning blue as you get colder and start turning orange as you get hotter. It will become icy if you are getting colder and fiery if you are getting hotter. It will also shake if you are hot or cold enough to take damage.\n\n\n#### Neutral:\n<img src=\"https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/ggmtYNuc/images/e3c69a4f9be896e32cf14ebd37f4cf240fa9cfd5.png\"  width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n\n#### Cold:\n<img src=\"https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/ggmtYNuc/images/a8fa37f97c493955b0fbfec647f91c89a26280ba.png\"  width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n\n\n#### Hot:\n<img src=\"https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/ggmtYNuc/images/5c7f92d95cd94c9c6629885d9a5194349a0cb30f.png\"  width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n\n&emsp;\n&emsp;\n&emsp;\n\nThe temperature display alone does not show your exact temperature as a number, but if you hold a thermometer in your offhand a display will pop up on your left showing your exact temperature. the number it shows is not any specific unit of temperature like celsius or fahrenheit. 50 is the most neutral.\n\n<img src=\"https://cdn-raw.modrinth.com/data/ggmtYNuc/images/d7174e2fc4a91741f75495a9c9cf50f4167ae4d2.png\"  width=\"50%\" height=\"50%\">\n\n\n&emsp;\n&emsp;\n&emsp;\n### Compatible\nCompatible with [Fabric Seasons](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-seasons).

Currently contains over **90** events hooks, networking\nabstraction, loader calls abstraction, game registry abstraction and an easy to use @ExpectPlatform annotation (Only\nworks on static methods).\n\n### Do I really need this API?\n\nArchitectury API is only one part of the architectury ecosystem, **Architectury Plugin** is the gradle plugin enabling\nall this multiplatform actions.\n\nArchitectury API is optional for projects built on architectury, you may create your architectury project with just\nArchitectury Plugin.\n\n### Advantages of Architectury\n\n- Open sourced\n- Less boilerplate for your multiplatform mod\n\n### Getting started with making multiplatform mods\n\nArchitectury Loom: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-loom (a fork of Fabric Loom adding multiplatform development capabilities)\n\nGradle Plugin: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-plugin (includes Architectury Injectables, for the `@ExpectPlatform` annotation)\n\nExample Mod: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-example-mod (a discontinued example mod using Architectury, if possible, use the templates instead)\n\nMod Templates: https://github.com/architectury/architectury-templates (a set of templates to get started using the Architectury toolchain)\n\n### Example: Usage of @ExpectPlatform\n![Exmaple of the @ExpectPlatform annotation, part of Architectury Injectables](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/78c68766affb70fbd88f9806e0e95f78765ec339448d7102065f2942be2b3215/68747470733a2f2f6d656469612e646973636f72646170702e6e65742f6174746163686d656e74732f3538363138363230323738313138383130382f3737363432383831343330393738353632302f756e6b6e6f776e2e706e673f77696474683d31313931266865696768743d343339)\n\n###

client-side mod that adds RPG-like titles when entering biomes or dimensions.\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Completely customizable - change text size, color, location, duration, &amp; more</li>\n<li><b>Includes built-in titles for many modded dimensions</b> - Atum, Twilight Forest, Bumblezone, Lost Cities, &amp; more!</li>\n<li>Supports <b>all modded biomes</b></li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom titles with the Waystones mod!</b> Will display a Waystone's title when you're near it (1.18+ Forge only)</li>\n<li>Supports <b>custom sounds</b> when entering new biomes, dimensions, or Waystone regions</li>\n<li>Dimension &amp; biome blacklisting</li>\n</ul>\n\n## Beautiful Custom Dimension Titles \n\n<p>\nTry out the beautiful <a title=\"Visual Traveler's Titles\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/visual-travelers-titles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visual Traveler's Titles</a> resource pack add-on by UnRoman for completely custom dimension titles! It includes support for a <em>bunch</em> of modded dimensions.\n</p>\n\n## Adding Custom Sounds\n<p>To use custom sounds, all you have to do is create a small resource pack with the namespace <code>travelerstitles</code>. In the <code>sounds</code> folder, you can add any or all of three custom sounds, named <code>dimension.ogg</code>, <code>biome.ogg</code>, and <code>waystone.ogg</code>. Each of these sounds will play when entering a new dimension, biome, and waystone, respectively. If no custom sound is provided for any of these, then no sound will play for the respective type of title.\n</p>\n\n## Additional Customization\n<p>Using lang files in resource packs, you can add your own dimension &amp; biome titles!<br />\nDimensions use a lang entry format like the following:</p>\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.namespace.dimensionname\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n<p>Biomes use the same lang entries as always, guaranteeing built-in support for any mod's biomes, like so:</p>\n\n<p><code>\"biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>However, should you want to change a vanilla or modded biome's title without potentially affecting other areas of the game that might use the biome's translation, you can use a special format specifically for this mod via the following:\n</p>\n\n<p><code>\"travelerstitles.biome.namespace.biomename\": \"Title\"</code></p>\n\n<p>Both dimensions and biomes also support an optional <code>color</code> lang entry which will override the configured default text color for that specific dimension or biome. The following is a complete example that adds a red title for the Nether and a green title for the Plains biome:<br />\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether\": \"The Nether\",\n\"travelerstitles.minecraft.the_nether.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.minecraft.plains\": \"Plains\",\n\"biome.minecraft.plains.color\": \"00ff00\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note that for a biome's <code>color</code> entry, it is also acceptable to have the key start with <code>travelerstitles</code>, and any biome color entry with <code>travelerstitles</code> prepended to it will take priority over other entries.<br />\nFor example, the following would resullt in blue (<code>0000ff</code>) text for the <code>desert</code> biome, since entries prepended with <code>travelerstitles</code> take priority:\n</p>\n\n<pre><code>\"biome.minecraft.desert.color\": \"ff0000\",\n\"travelerstitles.biome.desert.color\": \"0000ff\"</code></pre>\n\n<p>Also note that colors are RGB hex-formatted strings.</span></p>\n\n<p><a title=\"Lang entries\" href=\"https://github.com/YUNG-GANG/Travelers-Titles/tree/1.19/Common/src/main/resources/assets/travelerstitles/lang\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">See here</a> for the lang entries that come included with the mod in 1.19.2. Lang entries for other versions may be available on a different branch.</p>\n\n## Debug commands\n<p>The following commands work in single player worlds if you have sufficient permissions. They can be used to preview what titles will look like when you encounter them in the game.</p>\n\n<p><code>/biometitle &lt;biome&gt;</code><br />\n<code>/dimensiontitle &lt;dimension&gt;</code></p>","published":"2022-11-28T23:26:24.670551Z","updated":"2024-05-10T01:54:07.393811Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":555038,"followers":696,"categories":["adventure","decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["nIfqKsvT","yLYslqqw","8j6rQRir","U7s0a0fP","olf32JwT","yOjVCeqk","ZA3ahpCR","xcHI86YI","oUSK4sOQ","MbifZGB0","TTAtymNe","zbwk2CBy","vsCE3dyt","yMVTlUDY","Hyc60sDr"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/JtifUr64/5f218490f1edb9c55fd18e05f52247727117b93f.png"},"version":{"id":"xcHI86YI","project_id":"JtifUr64","author_id":"HCGwycZf","featured":false,"name":"[1.20] v4.0.1 (Fabric)","version_number":"1.20-Fabric-4.0.1","changelog":"1.20 and 1.20.1 release!

Let me know what you think on my Discord server!\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/ravine.gif)\n\n## Controls\n\nThe default controls are as follows, but can be modified:\n\n- Mouse x axis to roll\n- Mouse y axis to pitch\n- strafe keys (normally A and D) to yaw\n\n## Configuration\n\nThe mod can be configured in-game using [ModMenu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [YACL](https://modrinth.com/mod/yacl).\nOnce you install both of these,\nyou can access the config screen by finding the mod in the mods list and pressing the config button.\n\nA wide range of options are available, including custom mouse behavior, elytra activation restrictions and\nchanging values of modifiers like banking, sensitivity and more.\n\n## Server-side features\n\nVisual aspects of the mod (playermodel roll in particular) can be synced between \nclients by installing it on the server-side as well. \nEverything is still fully compatible with both vanilla clients and servers. \nAll the following configurations are valid:\n\n- Server with mod, client with mod: visuals are synced\n- Server with mod, client without mod: client can join and play without issues, but can't see visuals\n- Server without mod, client with mod: client can join and play without issues, but can only see their own visuals\n- Server with mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can see each other's visuals, client 3 cannot\n- Server without mod, client 1 with mod, client 2 with mod, client 3 without mod: client 1 and 2 can only see their own visuals\n\n![](https://github.com/enjarai/do-a-barrel-roll/raw/1.19.4/dev/img/do-a-barrel-roll.gif)\n\n## Disclaimers\n\nThis mod does not actually modify the flight physics themselves, \nso in most cases it shouldn't trigger anticheat. \nHowever, doing things like loop de loops looks to the server like rapid camera movement\nand may get you flagged.\n**Use at your own risk.**\n\n**Versions prior to 2.8.3 may not be suitable for use on multiplayer servers due to lax server-side restrictions**\n\n## Credits\n\nBased on the [Cool Elytra Roll](https://github.com/Jorbon/cool_elytra) mod by [Jorbon](https://github.com/Jorbon),\nspecifically it's \"realistic mode\".\n\nOriginally ported to Forge by [MehVahdJukaar](https://github.com/MehVahdJukaar).\nModern Forge port based on [Sinytra's multiloader template](https://github.com/Sinytra/MultiLoader-Template).\n\nMod icon by

A high-level technical description of the changes is available [here](https://github.com/malte0811/FerriteCore/blob/main/summary.md).\n\nThe amount of memory saved will depend on the pack. In version 2.5.9 of [All Of Fabric 3](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/all-of-fabric-3) it reduces the RAM usage (heap size) from 1,792 MB to 984 MB. For comparison the same setup with Hydrogen instead of FerriteCore uses 1,335 MB.  \nThese values were measured after generating a world with a fixed seed and waiting for two minutes.\nThe project picture is a cropped version of [this](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Magnetic-core_memory,_at_angle.jpg) picture.\n\n### FAQ\n\n#### Should I install this on the server or just on the client?\n\nSome optimizations are client-side only, but there are some rather high-impact optimizations that are relevant on the server too. So you should install it on both sides.\n\n#### Is this compatible with [other mod]?\n\nMost likely yes. The only exception is Hydrogen, which is compatible with all recent FerriteCore versions *on Minecraft versions where Hydrogen is officially released*. This means that 1.18+ builds are not compatible with Hydrogen, since it has been officially archived and won't receive any releases on these versions.","published":"2021-04-03T07:04:43.971189Z","updated":"2024-05-01T06:08:18.836384Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":5690442,"followers":5153,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["GeyB7u1y","Mc6hHgQU","hjsymojR","LG5zF5LP","5rLOvzfo","2XHUVaPQ","HjttFjoa","JQl5JoCm","oP38VFTJ","1FrNtQTK","OhmGV4Hp","c9p5gemS","FMdIAsIi","OhuTVpQH","776Z5oW9","AvWRJcqx","zkszypjI","7epbwkFg","xyl3NViI","fwozdl4o","fs07zE6w","6gwDuh90","3UkWIj4a","kwjHqfz7","CtXsUUz6","GHcKib6J","YrvjR5sX","RbR7EG8T","zI3uKvrU","l9p9zXTR","FCnCG6PS","ULSumfl4","unerR5MN","DG5Fn9Sz","tfQSdUpc","85kC2OMr","pguEMpy9","agJm6Vrw","PPnbi6JY","HWBrlwWv","i9RcCdZv"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/icon.jpg"},"version":{"id":"unerR5MN","project_id":"uXXizFIs","author_id":"cXzLZ8YY","featured":false,"name":"6.0.1 (Fabric/Quilt)","version_number":"6.0.1","changelog":"- Fix performance issue in quad deduplication in some corner cases\n- Slightly improve memory usage for blocks with only one state","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-22T13:39:15.937801Z","downloads":1613342,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8fa3b84fc5860dbc30fdf8cced02af68dffcf3fa","sha512":"9b7dc686bfa7937815d88c7bbc6908857cd6646b05e7a96ddbdcada328a385bd4ba056532cd1d7df9d2d7f4265fd48bd49ff683f217f6d4e817177b87f6bc457"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/uXXizFIs/versions/unerR5MN/ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","filename":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar","primary":true,"size":125197,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"2JhABx1f","user":{"id":"cXzLZ8YY","username":"malte0811","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10406104?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2021-01-29T18:51:24.633575Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"ferritecore-6.0.1-fabric.jar"},"mods\\ShoulderSurfing-Fabric-1.20.1-2.7.jar":{"sha512":"3c9db2f45c13c6f439ce5194df6ea641fd504621cf7476e2c8dacddf4ff0e3f35f69538e5190bf323a6097fc483bcf203748ef2fcdea410f1f812855902ae2c5","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"kepjj2sy","slug":"shoulder-surfing-reloaded","project_type":"mod","team":"rbOXH6PN","title":"Shoulder Surfing Reloaded","description":"Revamped over-the-shoulder F5 third-person camera view","body":"# Shoulder Surfing Reloaded #\nShoulder Surfing Reloaded is a highly configurable third person camera mod for minecraft.\n\n# Features #\n* Over-the-shoulder camera - see what you are interacting with in 3rd person\n* Decoupled camera - walk left and right without turning your mouse\n* Free look (default: `left alt`) - keep walking in a direction while looking in a different one\n* Hotkeys to move the camera (default: `arrow keys`, `page up` and `page down`, `o` to switch shoulders)\n* Corrective cross-hair positioning when using adaptive or dynamic crosshair\n* Adaptive player transparency - fades the player model to transparent when view is obstructed\n* Highly configurable - customize your 3rd person experience with many configuration options\n* Client side only - no server mods required\n\n# Installation #\n## Forge ##\n### Prerequisites ###\n1.

and Squishy animations for pistons","body":"This tiny mod adds the telescopic piston arm animation seen in Bedrock Edition to Java, as well as the option for a squishier alternative animation and particle emission.\n\nIt's also compatible with the [G4mespeed mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/g4mespeed) for smoother piston animations over all.\n\nThis mod requires the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) to run!\n\n\nIncluded are a few add-on Resource Packs which offer:\n- Sticky Piston sides\n- Squishing Bellows\n- Scissors/Springs\n\n(all of these support PBR)\n\n\nQuick guide for Resource Pack developers:\n\n- Model the piston arm around the vanilla piston_head models and put those in your pack as normal\n- Split those models such that everything you want to not squish and to move at regular speed is in the piston_head_short models, and the arm parts are in a piston_arm model in the assets/telepistons/models/block/ directory\n- Add the following to your piston_arm.json:\n```\n    \"telepistons\": {\n    \t\"squish\":\"false\",\n    \t\"particles\":\"4\",\n    \t\"squishedScale\": [ 1, 1, 0 ]\n        }\n```\n- \"squish\" and \"particles\" determine whether the arm model gets squished and whether pistons emit steam particles respectively\n- \"squishedScale\" determines the scale of the arm model once fully squished, i.e. the piston has fully retracted. Z points forward, so a vector of [1, 1, 0] will squish the arm just in that direction, while a vector of [2,2,0] will also make it get twice as wide and tall as it is squished.\n\nFound a bug or want to suggest a feature?

(primarily used to support the random model feature, the config screen, and allow textures set in models to vary like in OptiFine)\n\n#### Highly recommended\n- [Entity Culling](https://modrinth.com/mod/entityculling): This mod does wonders for reducing entity rendering lag, doing even more than Sodium's included entity culling. This is very beneficial when using animation heavy packs like Fresh Animations.\n\n\n## Fresh Animations?\nYes.\n\nit works :)\n\n<img width=\"450\" src=\"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/images/2f32dbeadc25e46ef6c56f0e47e5eb5d305c8ea2.png\">\n\n<br>\n\n[Download Fresh Animations](https://www.planetminecraft.com/texture-pack/fresh-animations-v1-0/)\n\n\n## Features & OptiFine differences & Known Bugs\n\nUp-to-date feature details page : [Features & Optifine differences](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/blob/master/FEATURES.md)\n\n\n## FAQ\n\n> **Q:** Do all OptiFine CEM resource packs work?\n\n**A:** Most packs work fine, but I'm sure there are some exceptions, report any found issues [here](https://github.com/Traben-0/Entity_Model_Features/issues), or on my [discord](https://discord.com/invite/rURmwrzUcz).\n\n> **Q:** What's different between EMF and dorianpb's [CEM](https://modrinth.com/mod/cem)?\n\n**A:** EMF is in a complete state and has a nearly 1 to 1 parity with OptiFine CEM, EMF also does a few extra things like player animations and armor model support, with more ideas on the way :)\n\nEMF also does things differently under the hood with little to no hardcoding of support for vanilla models. Allowing full CEM support for various modded entities.\n\n> **Q:** Backports?\n\n**A:** Backports to 1.18 & 1.19 are planned.\nBackports to version 1.17 and below are not planned at this time.\n\n## License\n\nEMF is licensed under the [GNU Lesser Public License](LICENSE), version 3.0\n\n## Hosting Partner deal\n\n[![image](https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/BVzZfTc1/images/bfb592538f8206a6a2d72d19c90714bea91b0e07.png)](https://billing.kinetichosting.net/aff.php?aff=641)","published":"2023-03-31T23:58:40.453948Z","updated":"2024-04-30T16:41:16.485547Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":2743094,"followers":2176,"categories":["mobs","utility"],"additional_categories":["decoration"],"game_versions":["1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20-pre1","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["yYaRtPUw","nXG5ZTWm","pcLQFqon","rVKOnrA7","T7mzJLz6","Dea94PIY","DjswzKtj","aDp7snRT","V2OyfXxm","Xd7QIIv1","GlVrMJfd","TEAO0eWy","6WfVnhiq","3ArUcFku","zTnuaNyR","I8BdGIyR","7bzU6chG","deVKWS49","MjDE57Jw","weH0Em4N","OZhKhqbO","Y4ERRvDT","7eRoc49u","8GH17mIS","NZKwy6yr","AzRidGwG","IL4RqqYZ","mOmY1cMH","EYEiSxf5","PuJLEdhx","5v32yTeK","F2rVuihD","kouKrQ96","ZZGFPXZF","ORrfX7aq","OPyB18gz","yVjuZyf5","e9hB4Qyw","NF2Ro84F","yHUWdpcz","nqu0vi2x","lu9zjvWC","n1DH6PLf","VfoKtE8J","akfHUoQf","TVhwNuR0","4jkePyqP","E6OJ69z6","ZAuTqMfx","c9lEcqYf","30r5YeHU","LnM9TQxd","wEcxaFJT","slWSM9OY","9ODYgM48","n6EyQyeN","b1pJegrh","p1Qt8SIh","33ddTlVK","VBeUopG1","S8VuZDQ4","nIQedooe","PETiI2Yb","yGROrq68","8FU1BYfi","JtRlIyBy","z0tRTgFX","9N7ilgif","hVYDL7YQ","kFcIMH1Z","r0UjM8gx","NtxuH8Wk","toEX8PUQ","hBdLuluo","L5j5Cgt6","Fhs6XUdV","j6G5CGoD","UTk9KIPl","zO7oFMiv","4e3OPRfB","eg7GqpgR","KKMsC88r","h4PnMR7D","AXMXly1R","K22doPG2","F3Urf59I","BA8z5Ryk","P6h6WCIY","PRB8TBBT","GZoWb3Sj","DqAqkeNx","IvKEtlkS","8iNRv6h2","Gnq4IVE1","EGtndKuU","9GIq2ND0","z5WFPrA6","zdcSsI7C","5VBMcfOB","OsioKrT1","xOy316Zc","Ac9PxwNw","1pzWwAvR","74Yx8tM6","WNdlhpAM","fbZGMUWW","KZVwrmUQ","TbpHIXxk","SS5qaBrE","8oFou220","zGa2nXth","ZnkxeBpm","ZVchszyB","tcrjMnUN","4seBWMhe","u3VqNoAu","c7TDawJ9","4ZslB2Hx","QEQnfRIO","uv7jW0CE","VifrfxZJ","5Pum9sao","r3qto42X","vyuiguoP","hxDtTc1Q","n5YI6Zh6","SH3Z72mF","S9HtDtJv","yvWntDTo","4vJjL6YG","95DrIgKD","7qhkYutC","9BeU4JMZ","DOvpgsS7","3DUWVimm","GCiXd1DU","lfYHLBCj","HuiMDCpB","KneJBt8W","dVfrkFFQ","rfh88j45","bwjbN1G7","kakr6cxQ","IzAfhCj5","rGuR7oQZ","fMRe5pGZ","652AHAwn","2hVd4znq","bCmmruN5","F1JjnEjo","mWAFiRcK","wa38cdv3","SfWhB6Bd","7bxh2EoP","aFlca15F","up2Xg2sy","jVIxXxpT","dzyn3ag2","mtJzKD3q","ORJKgPNp","rD5uCHNg","khwkB6ra","BitxFUOE","K0xj45PZ","9xVJZ8Xr","xvYCCPha","cqKSqPQH","gpqniM0d","QWCOTizL","ch6lB4Mh","ZBKoFavY","nAaR07o2","JN7NY56L","at9xKHYT","9PuZ3Kv1","sZcSLicd","S7FrTSoe","nYfJt8sH","OUq3XNDY","5SZ2FbHC","BzcsKF0w","av84l2vE","9BVLcBub","jkLvxFFA","g2i5i750","FTmtYNdf","84vLaMxp"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/4I1XuqiY/7a6acd528931a1a0d1b60fd0925b88227fb345cc.png"},"version":{"id":"5VBMcfOB","project_id":"4I1XuqiY","author_id":"rLbuLV6t","featured":false,"name":"[EMF] Entity Model Features 1.1.0","version_number":"1.1.0","changelog":"1.1.0\n\n- fixed `rule_index` variable using the wrong value\n- fixed `random()` method breaking when used with no args\n- fixed `Non [a-z0-9/._-] character in path` crash with modded entities having model id's that do not create valid Identifiers/ResourceLocations\n- fixed wolf collar models only being separate from the base model if a wolf_collar.jem was present *(wolves share their base model with the collar renderer in vanilla)*\n- fixed `!` boolean inverting not applying to `varb` variable booleans\n- added `keyframe()` & `keyframeloop()` animation methods to simplify keyframe format animations, the format is \n`keyframe(k, a, b, c,...)` with `k` being the linear progress of the keyframes (typically a timer), and all further values being the individual keyframes value.\nIn practise, k=0 will output the value of keyframe `a`,\nk=1 will output the value of keyframe `b`, and k=1.5 will give a linear output halfway between `b` & `c`.

Torches will give you a combat advantage!  \nWhile holding a torch you can set on fire your enemies, for an easier exploration or an early-game alternative to Fire Aspect.\n\n## **Compatibility**\nCompatible with [Soul Fire'd](https://modrinth.com/mod/soul-fire-d) and with any modded torch!  \n![Soul hit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/torch-hit/soul-hit.gif) ![Mod hit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/torch-hit/mod-hit.gif)\n\n## **Features**\n- Hit with a torch in your main hand to deal fire damage!  \n![Hit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/torch-hit/hit.gif)\n- Hit with a tool in your main hand and a torch in your off hand to deal fire damage!  \n![Tool hit](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/torch-hit/tool-hit.gif)\n- If Soul Fire'd is installed, soul torches set mobs on soul fire!  \n  If it's not installed, soul torches lit Piglins on fire for double the time and any other entity for 1 second more!  \n- **Highly configurable!** See next section for more details.\n\n## **Configuration**\n- By default direct (main hand) torch hits deal fire damage for 4 seconds, same as Fire Aspect I.  \n  The duration can be configured.\n- By default indirect (off hand) torch hits are enabled and work with any tool, dealing fire damage for 2 seconds.  \n  The duration, tool list and whether enabling this feature can all be configured.\n- New items can be made to behave as torches, defaults to a list of the most common modded torches.\n- By default, candles work as torches too! However they break if used to attack.  \n  Whether candles break when used and whether to enable this feature at all can be configured.\n- By default torches and candles always set targets on fire and only candles break upon use.  \n  Whether also torches should break, the chance of setting targets on fire and whether to break items can all be configured.  \n- By default Vanilla torches can be used to deal fire damage.  \n  If you wish to tweak the game balance, Vanilla torches can be prevented from dealing fire damage and only the extra items in the configuration will work.  \n- By default mobs wielding torches can set other entities (players included) on fire.  \n  This option can be disabled.\n\n\n## **Dependencies**\n| Mod | Loader | Requirement |\n| :-: | :----: | :---------: |\n| [Forge Config API Port](https://modrinth.com/mod/forge-config-api-port) | Fabric | Required |\n| [Fabric Polyfill](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-polyfill) | Fabric (1.16.5 & 1.18.2) | Required |\n| [Soul Fire'd](https://modrinth.com/mod/soul-fire-d) | Fabric/Forge | Optional |\n\n## **License and right of use**\nFeel free to use this mod for any modpack or video, just be sure to give credit and possibly link [here](https://github.com/crystal-nest/torch-hit#readme).  \nThis project is published under the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://github.com/crystal-nest/torch-hit/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n## **Support us**\n\n<a href=\"https://crystalnest.it\"><img alt=\"Crystal Nest Website\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/crystal-nest/pic512.png\" width=\"14.286%\"></a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/BP6EdBfAmt\"><img alt=\"Discord\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/discord/discord512.png\" width=\"14.286%\"></a><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/crystalspider\"><img alt=\"Patreon\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/patreon/patreon512.png\" width=\"14.286%\"></a><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/crystalspider\"><img alt=\"Ko-fi\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/kofi/kofi512.png\" width=\"14.286%\"></a><a href=\"https://github.com/Crystal-Nest\"><img alt=\"Our other projects\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/github/github512.png\" width=\"14.286%\"><a href=\"https://modrinth.com/organization/crystal-nest\"><img alt=\"Modrinth\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/modrinth/modrinth512.png\" width=\"14.286%\"></a><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/members/crystalspider/projects\"><img alt=\"CurseForge\" src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crystal-nest/mod-fancy-assets/main/curseforge/curseforge512.png\" width=\"14.286%\"></a>\n\n[![Bisect Hosting](https://www.bisecthosting.com/partners/custom-banners/d559b544-474c-4109-b861-1b2e6ca6026a.webp \"Bisect Hosting\")](https://bisecthosting.com/crystalspider)\n","published":"2023-01-13T17:52:18.632487Z","updated":"2024-01-13T16:45:57.034503Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":60738,"followers":76,"categories":["adventure","game-mechanics","utility"],"additional_categories":["equipment"],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.18.2","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["XVarJX3C","xszhmRcc","OJRQskXo","v051eg9P","DeUmwpex","ilmWejvo","ePRukbYJ","K1bV9Q7T","bRFEdjTk","NAJUvFOi","BEfXIIiF","lOOg75FA","KjIuSiXj","Xp1Xgbsj","pdFNiaxF","d1SdFy07","Akth3hkI","Pl2cIjed","rSEsbWsU","x3tpZ7zG","bNtctpBq","c2BbT5p1","cnCb0ccn","wporAiq2","gsYeOvSN","87sY21YA","2MlUgxyF","lxbG6YZ8","dqzUq8aw","uarjxCN7","pPt8eglq","UF8LgDbE","qwRN7dTE","qHBm8CnR","U4fuJMPT","jaDvxNCB","dQlwgGr5","9JLU3ATF"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/zTOq9jEI/4615cd0f800dd2e1557faf308a16c20475bdda19.gif"},"version":{"id":"uarjxCN7","project_id":"zTOq9jEI","author_id":"9xBEY6Nv","featured":false,"name":"[Fabric - 1.20.1] Torch hit!

Basically, almost every **hostile mob** has been reworked, from small changes to huge ones.

There are now also a few **achievements** to make the experience even funnier!\n\nAlthough we've changed almost every mob already, feel free to ask for new features or changes in the [GitHub](https://github.com/sf-inc/sihywtcamd/issues) or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/eNwkve8k7c).

Examples include:\n\n- Exposing functionality that is useful but difficult to access for many mods such as particles, biomes and dimensions\n- Adding events, hooks and APIs to improve interopability between mods.\n- Essential features such as registry synchronization and adding information to crash reports.\n- An advanced rendering API designed for compatibility with optimization mods and graphics overhaul mods.\n\nAlso check out [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader), the (mostly) version-independent mod loader that powers Fabric. Fabric API is a mod like any other Fabric mod which requires Fabric Loader to be installed.\n\nFor support and discussion for both developers and users, visit [the Fabric Discord server](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv).\n\n## Using Fabric API to play with mods\n\nMake sure you have install fabric loader first.

At 0 - 99%, you will recieved a \"_You may not rest now; You are not tired enough_\" message when attempting to use a bed.  \n\n![Too tired text](https://github.com/Lemonszz/SleepRework/blob/1.20/meta/not_tired.png?raw=true)\n\nAfter successfully sleeping, your tiredness will be reset to 0%.  \nThe maximum level of Tiredness is 500%. \n\n### Phantoms  \nWhen your tiredness level reaches 300% (by default), Phantoms have a chance to spawn on you.  \nAs your tiredness level increases, more Phantoms will spawn at once. \n\n### Potions  \nSleep Rework adds two new types of potion:\n\n#### Liveliness  \nLiveliness will decrease your Tiredness gain by 0.5x (by default) per potion level.  \nLiveliness Potions can be brewed with an Awkward Potion and a Honeycomb.\n\n#### Drowsiness  \nDrowsiness will increase your Tiredness gain by 2x (by default) per potion level.  \nDrowsiness Potions can be brewed by corrupting a Liveliness Potion with a Fermented Spider Eye\n\n[**See More on our Mechanics wiki page**](https://github.com/Lemonszz/SleepRework/wiki/Mechanics)\n\n## Configuration  \n[**See our Configuration wiki

Compared to vanilla, Better Fortresses are much larger, more complex, and more rewarding. Each fortress is comprised of three parts — the bridge networks, the Keep, and the Lava Halls that extend deep underground.\n</p>\n<p>\n<b>YUNG's Better Nether Fortresses also includes built-in Create compatibility!</b> If you're using Create, certain parts of the fortress have a chance of spawning using Create pieces.

If you like this content, I'm sure you'll like that modpack, too. Welcome to check it out!**\n\n---\nAlso, This mod is a remastered version of [You Thief!](https://modrinth.com/datapack/you-thief!). This time, we made a more precise mechanic, waiting for you to challenge!\n\nNow when you open or break the villagers' chests or barrels in the village, the villagers nearby will get angry and raise the trade prices extremely. \n\nThe mechanic is based on the vanilla gossip system of villagers. So, if the iron golems hear what you did from the villagers, they will attack you too. You will also get a bad luck effect for a day. Now think twice about the consequences before you steal!\n\nLocation will be detected, you will only offend villagers and iron golems when opening chests/barrels in the village. Placing/opening/breaking your own chest/barrel will not offend villagers.\n\nBut...You plan to place a chest next to Villagers', and combine them into a big one? Nope.Nice try.The villagers are smart enough to know your trick. But they are kind of stupid, too.If you place your chest near a natrual generated chest, they cannot recognize that, so they may mistake it. Don't confuse them!\n\nSo, how to steal \"correctly\"? Think about how do you steal Piglins'! You can also try the magical way. Drink invisibility potion, be completly invisible, and you can do whatever you want!\n\n## Feel a bit harsh? We made it rewarding to be a thief! Now the loots in village chests & barrels have been *doubled*!\n\nThis mod is not compatible with Lootr.\n\n**Credits**\n- Thank Heket for making this into a real mod!\n\n- The cover is made with resource pack [Fresh Animation](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/fresh-animations) by FreshLX\n\n## 版权声明|License\n- **作者保留该作品的所有权利。禁止在其他社交平台（包括群聊、网盘等）重新上传或商用，否则后果自负。** This content is All Rights Reserved, meaning that you cannot redistribute/modify & distribute this content, or use it in commercial ways. \n\n- **欢迎您将其收录到整合包中或用其制作视频，请在简介处附上此发布页面的链接和[我的bilibili主页](https://space.bilibili.com/190900020)，也欢迎在简介艾特我，我很想看你们的视频！**\nIf you make a video about this content or put this content in your modpack, please give credit and link to this page, and I would love to know!

Specifically, it makes the initialization of DataFixerUpper \"lazy\" - that is, it will not immediately create the rules required to migrate data from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions until it actually needs to do so.\n\n**This mod is for Fabric/Quilt**\n\n## Compatibility\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.2 is compatible with Minecraft 1.14 through 1.18.2, and works on the client and server side.\n\nLazyDFU 0.1.3 is compatible with Minecraft 1.19 and above, however Mojang now implements the functionality LazyDFU provides on the server side. The client still initializes all DFU rules by default, so LazyDFU hooks into the native client functionality that enables DFU rule baking and turns it into a no-op.\n\n**As of Minecraft 1.19.4 and above, however, Mojang has significantly optimized DFU initialization enough that this mod is no longer necessary in many configurations. It will continue to be supported for older versions of Minecraft.**\n\n## Sponsor me!\n\nDid this mod make Minecraft playable for you? [Chip in a bit of money](https://github.com/sponsors/astei) so I can continue developing it.\n\n## Why does it work?\n\nDataFixerUpper (often abbreviated to DFU) is the Minecraft component responsible for handling world upgrades from older versions of Minecraft to newer versions. DFU is initialized very early in the Minecraft startup process - in fact, it's initialized before the game window even appears. It is laughably overengineered and very slow, but it's what Mojang gives us to work with.\n\nAs part of the DFU initialization process, it caches rules required to convert from older versions to MInecraft through every version in between, up to the version of the game being launched. This process takes place in the background, but it is _extremely_ slow, as it is both CPU and memory intensive. With Minecraft 1.16.5, I have measured this process take 9 seconds on a Ryzen 9 3900X desktop (a high-end desktop CPU released in 2019) and 57 seconds on a laptop with an i5-8250U (a mid-range laptop chip from 2017).\n\nAll LazyDFU does is stop this process - it lets DFU initialize, but it will force it to not cache all these rules. As a result, the DFU rules are only compiled when a world needs to be converted. This means it is possible you may see lag spikes if LazyDFU forces the game to compile migration rules, but once complete there is no performance penalty.\n\n## Prove it to me\n\nI [recorded a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXDqJ598kKA) that shows you how effective LazyDFU is.\n\n## Comparing it to other mods\n\nIn comparison to other mods, LazyDFU has the primary advantage of being _simple_, _safe_, and having _low impact_ on the game.\n\n* LazyDFU is a very simple mod. The entire mod is about a dozen lines of code, about as uncomplicated as a mod can get, while still delivering huge benefits. (This means it's also an ideal mod to use to experiment with a new Mixin platform!)\n* LazyDFU is highly compatible and safe. LazyDFU is extremely unlikely to conflict with other mods. This mod is based on a similar patch in [Paper](https://papermc.io) that had been in use for over a year with no reported issues with migrating to newer versions of Minecraft. (Paper has since changed to replacing Mojang's data fixers with a highly optimized implementation of its own.)","published":"2021-01-04T05:14:07.259717Z","updated":"2022-06-08T01:13:18.555078Z","client_side":"optional","server_side":"optional","downloads":3175642,"followers":3588,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14","1.14.1","1.14.2","1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric"],"versions":["8tFjDrHf","aBDhdWUD","C6e265zK","4SHylIO9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/hvFnDODi/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"4SHylIO9","project_id":"hvFnDODi","author_id":"y0WF9UR5","featured":false,"name":"0.1.3","version_number":"0.1.3","changelog":"* Update to Minecraft 1.19\n* Mojang now (by default) does not build datafixer rules on servers.

Also easily allows respriting and retexturing existing textures, specifically useful to add new wood based blocks.\n\n \n\n- Dynamic block set registration\nAllows mods to specify a block set (which can be for example a wood type). The mod then will scan all registered blocks and fill the block set up only to then allow mods to register blocks that depend on it.\n\nThis can't be easily done using traditional methods since the wood set itself depends on the registered blocks so registration must happen at a very specific time. This utility makes that task possible and easy to do. Note that it is still a form of dynamic registration which might have some drawbacks.\n\nIn a nutshell you have dynamic wood type support for your blocks. The wood set type already comes built-in.\n\n \n- Custom map markers: \nA complete system that allows to easily implement and add map decoration and map markers as well as control every aspect of them like rendering. Also allows storing simple data inside maps data offering a couple of hooks to use it too like on item tooltip.\nThis system also offers a simple Data Driven implementation meaning you can easily register new markers with datapacks!\n \n\n- Dynamic Villager AI\nA helper system to easily and dynamically add tasks and modify villager schedules in a compatible way without overriding the whole existing AI. Also allows to properly add memory types\n\n \n\n- Custom first and third person animations:\nAllows modders to implement a simple interface in their items to allow it to have custom third and first person animations (like crossbows). \nIncludes simple and easy to use interfaces that can let you control first person and third person animations as well as a callback for rendering the item itself (similar to spyglass) directly in your item class\n\n \n- Grindstone achievement triggers:\nThe mod adds a custom trigger that gets called when an item is passed through a grindstone that you can call in your mods advancements jsons\n\n\n- Soft fluid system:\nAn entirely Data Driven custom virtual fluid system that goes on top of forge one and is designed to fit better in vanilla minecraft and having as main feature the ability to have multiple fluid containers items like bottles, bowls and buckets, as well as providing support for stews and drinks that can be consumed directly from a fluid tank. As opposed to the forge fluid system it has a base unit of 1 minecraft bottle (250 forge mb). The system also automatically generates all the needed fluids for already registered forge fluids and allows the user to override them or add to them easily. Fluids are virtual so they can only exist in modded container specifically for them\n \n\n-Dispenser utilities:\nSome code that allows to easily register dispenser behaviors without overriding already existing ones. Also comes with builtin spawn egg and block placement behaviors\n\n ","published":"2022-06-21T07:56:14.814685Z","updated":"2024-05-26T08:23:06.806457Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1604059,"followers":466,"categories":["library"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.16.5","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.4"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge"],"versions":["2vA7za0R","HnzRVHve","VFJlAomw","TdrX8qHu","ND0jV6Ba","wMvYwhzf","YZ1c6V1Y","7KfOaFNC","n36VFZgj","hjpH6YTS","TZqLAjc4","SNOfTsuq","BpwfruOR","ARzMom8z","bSd7CaVX","bYgSpZNX","sFlS58kl","MunWW5CV","ip1Rzqeo","VYcJMwhh","77PCqM0x","EWKHMqhL","48KdkfGF","LHQnKJPr","SUVVyNOn","iUir8IFb","CAaiQgHc","mMuXnmER","5CAvXUDI","Y9Yo8h10","Cwn2eAQI","1ZP9jeJp","JwDuktzc","aNax4jyH","RIqvRzdD","ANPz3UX0","wkQInAdt","5vaqrscY","rvr9aKfC","mzGChtna","dVl8oHMC","qfTdrUeL","KbGlKdHo","S3OlMtz3","zGJuxvK4","MwH6iRuX","GSlj8ip7","4x52sEBq","ZZzULVfd","sS7WRpan","hbIxgIk3","gO19W71w","4jTOJ2ZI","oZ6GRhj8","VhZo5bM4","TQkusKt9","368y55MX","8ZMdWvwz","r4wBdvIX","f5gtva35","8hghdRdh","GxCfXdHN","jwSm2KiR","F0NN8t9F","h4yyiupT","hzwrgZl8","gA9vpijP","KdTmjJVb","HjrG1F0r","fwqQVTzC","3WC47wPk","XMHhMXZd","G82otMKn","bjFaEsLT","Pi6AVDbd","1R2xmUor","Ti5Z22lJ","IVC9YnMt","gmoV0tyd","2PY4BLur","zLddLJPF","5ZwEaffq","ZTvfXhRv","NF5WIl7b","yOVUWvRf","5KCmgfbm","9OTYJk7a","v3BxhM1S","BHmy40Mt","AWhKa778","uiUPREjo","VoARfnSD","Xxa877fY","u857rKSQ","rznUqNwu","cmz3IAL2","gdtVX62P","7wxkhoX2","sMEl6tss","2Uz8dh1y","OuwCxc61","5N5K36U1","jEMUwADf","xAJqgTD0","96TZidKH","FWVFXkyg","7JKL4wL5","ihYnBDx3","ROwff1j7","yrhbhfSn","ZHuO4LiU","pFeITkZi","y04tJAwP","YkBLE8Oq","LTmKAyph","UxWlwJoD","kyMgJhmx","pKTlrvKt","Ovxp7vPe","NtrvPW5Z","Z6GA4zUd","kP7srLfi","Xv8cPrF8","ebGaMVM5","KlX1F156","SV4rUTK3","9OGPgOeF","M1JtNLFm","50P4wZoB","kDFjJOMB","lIrlI8Zz","JXolKGKT","GTSq9qXH","ZVLcOJJE","BdAPfRTo","XWjG3vWP","hZxT2b1p","uBnHFMR2","I1r3C7CG","sE2tTJLZ","gUtSDU9U","Gp0CQft9","MG6apqgk","J5E9L4AG","8j22jNcF","tAcvUB1b","X46edIfU","OKx9Elr9","uOIpFARl","LkOHvzOj","FmgUqwxg","FLKgQQZH","sgNQlLLv","Bwn3tASZ","1tR7YwgX","n665AUFc","JBBeBPK6","S9PrveOz","sNFzpvYl","WXwbgZvj","IeVioShx","mvCZhlZo","o7oqq3Lh","vjQmGhyI","9dcfZ4i9","mCdzmJZC","hj1UnmZ2","idIlWA9u","PXyqXIbn","fQhx5ml2","fia9z4h4","cKg5hnPJ","mHeZr8dp","IPLC6g62","3NoxJuBX","pglf5GDl","SrPhRlSQ","vnTrMyMb","vehbL6pP","9Cgq74lp","EYDLWwqS","Hl9ja4Gl","Z8apZ6lb","UrzlfaAz","4fEnQ2ua","JoEQ35TB","XlRP5PMn","7cwLznr1","C86Th6Cw","N1eo0JjB","TkEXwUpi","R3HUuRlb","yvWnUxeS","gK3ltYEo","9eKKGLgl","81iXq8Ua","ifaZqqbi","wAEWAPPs","X0mWyHDn","3z15qPRG","yKc5hWwB","613mgPdm","6WCyArcu","FreWFSqP","QzsElbGY","g0I9zd9f","QYOUgJFZ","g5fu5BKB","jx8jTIax","7FTjFbHI","6UdNaxrX","QEr4oCmZ","whxnG6tI","lsj3hYsg","v8shmez8","dE1OqDFw","buvzG5Eh","LOutWSjK","Ta3wPFEM","f6naP7j6","h6yrGow9","nkCKWwmU","QYPLYuej","Eax5TmfX","NkDayjzv","BsdtnGcc","i8LcMgkg","GFChSR1Q","5Zza2cPD","mSQCkfvX","FaHHZhWB","CSWnYqKU","olYe4Pvg","8BzRkauW","hiH76w7r","XYaisWHj","9T5izdE9","s6wGYEq5","j6jDosOf","wFJ6kLiM","XtugKOOJ","uqfvv0ms","PM712gqw","2O4lu5JH","G4l3R3Pb","MXuvNr3i","KJQ6UUBP","cGKy75i2","7O9YniXA","WBx7Ddq6","LGgzYsHU","IUITd8aF","LhoPcVBA","dfWWDslj","5MTISIoq","vBIzpz3C","95iGLvuV","JmKTlMTk","RNUEccJ3","Sn17BhlX","jlMUHPST","4Pn6H6LU","YAbYzYmZ","Fc74Sq3o","xFsTt0Ku","8UWgitat","AgF88xAa","LAcFOrdR","3sq8rKNi","WXnNfkOQ","bRdRjsBw","2RKyBUJh","8BAEKNuN","cEVwMp3J","5NKdFoez","StBAz5jK","dRWTiq1o","dLc984Lh","OWzOhWa1","IVjsKfDz","cFgWr0uf","wnLFf0Nc","rCLaOh9e","zxsIL6hW","DKi9sJC8","7wOWxvtd","BMFYaPZ4","pg9Xxrcb","t5FnO6dP","zQA9lTQr","cv8vKRPe","TDf2CeG9","FubHdmUL","7NLlFrFF","8og81efu","NBLqXmpa","IZUE22nG","JQtrjbXM","Ss8gDP6F","Jv6lR8aV","Fi0TCD7O","6AG0cMX6","uMZCwusw","oi8DYts3","5QbwmlBE","n3GjNlx6","ycRzQlXJ","oTRatPAP","yquNskKL","CbCy1LiO","M8sd9nyu","e93w6V0s","hCmcGN2x","WtQPtpOg","OkmMqBP5","ypbJKwW0","wwZF0CTX","fNxFC0pt","PXdkmy2e","favv6G7H","jOzdT1LR","gnSKWxm4","ZgfYQJJR","7PV35Cya","s2SeQuIY","JDl2M220","LdkViV3L","kxERHwYJ","njpFMA6B","pk2qJx6m","UnP0v4AC","aeiy0BML","Go1eYHmQ","Cuzt6kYP","js8YrtNd","Asee8uGo","UYBCMpsC","iAUu6joU","xGNGCHkB","7r8TleZN","GaHAWKFN","aoXpagIV","5Ic61SOJ","Y2coeQBy","wldQnfTY","WRTGYYwK","rL76IQAG","kWp5Y5C9","FSr3bS7l","g1NYtQkD","sBdauEYc","jwHI7W1V","Hrg4AXGA","cP4hkgv1","CUoXbepB","zRXo9SbS","zYK4kSID","7X9Ap8XG","OS1Spie4","nOP9IgtT","qZEcqr3j","H78hNSMP","u5W05Nll","uKalHaQF","DCYqLiyn","yui9wjUi","vivHKObd","2RDhJhN7","unsnRxp1","elfXvPlb","QplPUcMZ","o50IGtrs","SBI44BXf","CV8lDNyD","2O5fg0oB","JEGquuvM","kxiwYQnp","tAnlg8ff","tNmV8F3e","bIIUFcYw","WOsQY4RE","qDW4WXAw","p6nioh9J","XdWNv88P","DoxaOeBf","fLxJRzSX","cdNu7PK8","l53OchaO","ZloMzYX2","luqVInL6","c1lxzTbA","ZOqeyUiV","ej91c9V8","93Yehddj","7saLSGbf","OOWX2Oij","Funmd64I","LazriRXO","oM4tZMNR","mrMZDCEp","dYm8xmxC","qaPBcEwV","W3TFpB71","xAoofRnn","uv4zha4H","erMSGCtZ","TrNPp0VJ","syE4OiG7","3WzCZus7","P1OnKMWx","z5otFTC5","EghVG3Df","4aP9Rkxt","X5QZyeHj","N9LlGRuD","yqHXozvj","rPFKzJR5","arDcM3bX"],"icon_url":"https:

**[Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium)** is installed.\n\n# Continuity\n\nContinuity is a Fabric mod built around modern APIs to allow for the most efficient connected textures experience possible. It is designed to provide full Optifine parity for all resource packs that use the Optifine CTM format. Continuity also supports Optifine-format emissive textures for block and item models.\n\nContinuity depends on the Fabric API and is client-side only. It includes two built-in resource packs - one provides default connected textures, similar to Optifine, and the other provides a fix for glass pane culling.\n\n## Forge Version\n\nA Forge version of Continuity will not be made for the following reasons.\n\n- Forge's model API: It is vastly different from Fabric's model API (FRAPI), which is readily utilized by Continuity, and switching to it would not only require an incredible amount of effort, but also result in the mod being extremely inefficient.\n- Optifine: It has native support for Forge and provides the same features as Continuity.\n\n### Links\n\n[CurseForge Page](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/continuity)\n","published":"2021-09-25T20:27:10.714654Z","updated":"2024-05-15T05:16:05.016498Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3722158,"followers":4811,"categories":["decoration","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["Xn8QzMB9","6JEV45oM","i0ccQghD","27YRAXEt","SffGs8Ro","yiOF0F2t","sD3iTKbB","gOxkykhO","Bl7pOAQf","zcqSiVI3","jjpzIZoY","xTtULC68","YEKdScFW","Ql3Ho9eR","4h5IIa7B","ImUFj5Gl","G2qoxVmV","OOpbpU2z","xy2co4Rh","JYaO3lPe","Z9FJWLMt","JXhQlDZl","Fc7h8MWD","MfBeYvQa","84Zs6tNo","Ox1racg8","hI13Vg85"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"Z9FJWLMt","project_id":"1IjD5062","author_id":"CdcF3lqY","featured":false,"name":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1","version_number":"3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-10-02T18:16:30.272151Z","downloads":1379679,"version_type":"beta","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"b662fd625ba1f06c6e4958eac373856047d0d2a9","sha512":"2a42ef76cd2a60af01fffed1cd9e08270b537f116f7fa0ede49a5b526fa7b9860845a6f321c4a7600f80e739391eb24a6e6d9850c33894b58bc2d01a8a63f8b4"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/versions/Z9FJWLMt/continuity-3.0.0-beta.4%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1050571,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"uoI5LZgV","user":{"id":"CdcF3lqY","username":"PepperCode1","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/user/CdcF3lqY/24a325b36c3ce10dbc1a86cc68c5eeb212784b63.png","bio":"","created":"2021-09-25T20:18:09.628691Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"84Zs6tNo","project_id":"1IjD5062","author_id":"CdcF3lqY","featured":false,"name":"3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.1","version_number":"3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.1","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-05-15T05:15:11.429367Z","downloads":69525,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"15ad75d51f567c69308b91223454bacfd2eda7a5","sha512":"8996e74dfe96ee845bdd25e2fc5ec73a73073b2b7945693a6058182a19fd8486c4d7f03de87a3369fb73a912411b8f9061a93f0fef77c4d729157de2f31e96be"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/1IjD5062/versions/84Zs6tNo/continuity-3.0.0-beta.5%2B1.20.1.jar","filename":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.5+1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":1009252,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"continuity-3.0.0-beta.4+1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\you-bandit!-2.0.jar":{"sha512":"edce4a341c336e80fc1688d1406263301f28e21ecc46c7045965e34bf2db5f7fc76186499e461368776de8b28df8275777d2885fca91c0ac646d5f2418551f50","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"FDbnFfSg","slug":"you-bandit!","project_type":"mod","team":"NFRuB8Yl","title":"You  Bandit!","description":"Join pillagers, loot villagers!","body":"This is originally for modpack [AnimateCraft: Lankeren](https://modrinth.com/modpack/animatecraft-lankeren).

Alright, I don't know why you think that way, but now I can let you do it in a cooler way.\n\nIntroducing ***You Bandit!***, a derive mod of ***[You Thief!](https://modrinth.com/mod/you-thief-remastered-edition)***. With this mod, you can choose to be a bandit, hang around with the illagers, and loot the villagers.\n\nAfter killing two villagers, you will get an unluck debuff, and you become a bandit, really simple.\n\nBeing a bandit means you will be hated by villagers and iron golems, the former will rise their trading prices, the latter will not stop chasing you.\n\nBut bandits have advantages. You are now much stronger, and the illagers will not attack you anymore!--Not until you betray them.\n\nWhen you kill one of the illagers (including witch and vex),  you will be cursed with a Bad Omen V. Even worse, you cannot use milk bucket to get rid of it or the consequence it brings--continuously spawned vexs around you! Now this is the real bad omen!\n\nWant to make up what you've done? Take the Bade Omen V to the village, and win the raid! Then you'll gain a Hero of the Village V, which can decrease the trader price to the original level (only a bit higher :))\n\n## 版权声明|License\n- **作者保留该作品的所有权利。禁止在其他社交平台（包括群聊、网盘等）重新上传或商用，否则后果自负。** This content is All Rights Reserved, meaning that you cannot redistribute/modify & distribute this content, or use it in commercial ways. \n\n- **欢迎您将其收录到整合包中或用其制作视频，请在简介处附上此发布页面的链接和[我的bilibili主页](https://space.bilibili.com/190900020)，也欢迎在简介艾特我，我很想看你们的视频！**\nIf you make a video about this content or put this content in your modpack, please give credit and link to this page, and I would love to know!

Register any field with only a simple annotation, regardless of mod loader!</li>\n<li>Custom reimplementation of Jigsaw Manager with improved performance and custom pool element types with various new properties. Check out the <a href=\"https://github.com/yungnickyoung/YUNGs-Better-Dungeons\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Better Dungeons code</a> to see it in action.</li>\n<li>New criteria trigger for safely locating any structure. If the given structure doesn't exist, the trigger simply fails rather than instantly passing (unlike vanilla).</li>\n<li>Interfaces for JSON serialization &amp; deserialization&nbsp;with built-in type adapters.</li>\n<li>Simple, lightweight math utilities for vectors and column positions</li>\n<li><em>BlockStateRandomizer</em> and <em>ItemRandomizer</em>, data abstractions that make adding block and item randomization to your structures incredibly simple.

Changes made to a server config only apply to that one world. Setting default values in server configs for all <strong>newly</strong> created worlds is possible by copying the modified server config to <code>/.minecraft/defaultconfigs/</code>.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">In a local singleplayer world you can quickly find config files by running the <code>/config showfile &lt;modid&gt;</code> command and by choosing <code>CLIENT</code>, <code>COMMON</code> or <code>SERVER</code>. Then click the file name (ending with .toml) that appears in chat to open the file in a text editor. After saving the file, the config will automatically reload in-game after a couple of seconds, so no game restart required.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">On some mod loaders editing configs is also supported in-game via the <strong>Mods</strong> menu option. On some Minecraft versions you can also install my <a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/config-menus-forge\"><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Config Menus for Forge</strong></span></a> mod for editing configs directly in-game.</span></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gPSmXZq.png\" width=\"854\" height=\"14\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:

FPS","description":"Reduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.","body":"# Dynamic FPS\n\nReduce resource usage while Minecraft is in the background or idle.\n\n## Features\n\nDynamic FPS will detect whether the Minecraft window is currently active, being hovered over, unfocused, or invisible.  \nFor each of these states you're able to adjust the frame rate, volume, and whether [toast notifications](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Toasts) are temporarily paused.\n\nThere's also an option to enter an idle state while the window is active but hasn't received any input in a certain amount of time.\n\n---\n\nIn addition to this Dynamic FPS fixes a vanilla bug causing higher-than-necessary background CPU usage and stops \nrendering the world while it's being obscured by opaque screens or the resource loading overlay, helping especially on low-end systems.\n\n## Installation\n\nDynamic FPS is available for download on [GitHub](https://github.com/juliand665/Dynamic-FPS/releases), [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/dynamic-fps), and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/dynamic-fps).  \nTo access the in-game config screen you'll also need to install [Mod Menu](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu) and [Cloth Config](https://modrinth.com/mod/cloth-config).\n\n## Frequently Asked Questions\n\n- Why is Minecraft still running at 15 FPS?\n\nDynamic FPS will only slow the client render loop to a minimum of 15 cycles per second.\nLower frame rates are achieved by then cancelling the rendering of all superfluous frames, e.g. 14 out of 15 frames are cancelled for 1 FPS.\n\nThis lets you resume playing almost instantly after switching back to the game:\nInstead of having to wait for up to a second until the next rendered frame comes along, the game checks back within 1/15th of a second.\n","published":"2020-12-01T15:57:46.862046Z","updated":"2024-05-29T16:56:29.745738Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":3691454,"followers":3536,"categories":["optimization","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.14.3","1.14.4","1.15","1.15.1","1.15.2","1.16.2-pre1","1.16.2-pre2","1.16.2-pre3","1.16.2-rc1","1.16.2-rc2","1.16.2","1.16.3-rc1","1.16.3","1.16.4-pre1","1.16.4-pre2","1.16.4-rc1","1.16.4","20w45a","20w46a","20w48a","20w49a","20w51a","1.16.5-rc1","1.16.5","21w03a","1.17","1.17.1-pre1","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a","24w21a","24w21b","1.21-pre1","1.21-pre2"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["kurPEwi6","gVvtLF6M","XlBOTUIQ","muZxaaxq","oIZUkvvs","RgJGw0dO","Co2w6nIh","LttnLLIj","g9FOSLTq","tChVqk53","Usg995P0","Dfw5rXkQ","8feSMAfR","BRhzFUHi","NzEhyQyc","hWM6qcqA","sejsYSOg","53FTYNg4","8ZK3Yrx8","5LX1Blqr","gi2eS21F","NeKJoURy","3WUIXnPq","MT0Hhrmt","xJziTz7j","KBaicJn7","MJxmQ042","HyfaQLUy","ufaW1r8S","1npK5wCt","apxb2RCR","k6MHtC5D","QLkpv8Ld","5NDr40VW","qU25ZOM2","e2GoOHqC","LLW6Rz4X","tBXQeb6B","PdOcOZe5","IC26VVbo","aIfiOstF","6XTTKHFs","wOSxC0Zb","lffwyl3t","EqKUlwIM","E8I4fCdF","TiEIglop","6ZZnpiKt","RaQsEbig","IntaQuNq","8zD1HoDT","cBDPkvTM","kmNGyLFl","lHhemLYM","JzqaccpR","DIVSdFSY","ON9j8VE4","OeMT2cC8","ksK11lcD","Ec4NqAob","XzHVv85p","nLicebq0","OZ1kEY2A","2A0fjGIj","UL1yMXMO","RdFrLKPC","v2hnzsRt","9ItmBJnL","eghSjWeK","mwACShkf","tpCuDULl","IORbL2mx","EhV5xUXs","tGTBddY1","yhhpGEhV","QBGkeC7m","4YGsF2sR","XGwn4gNc","THG0PVdn","9HB3KfC8","PnFGjxcb","3eTIv2kA","CD4gyQlk","qU5QelCK","akci2PEc","hdO7gDw8","xRLXdhYl","xCKeVizz","O7a5N5VT","SsL3jQXt","r8rpH64x","eGHFlVzX","pR3KcCvX","E4fdZphD","RRLjJEKm","tQFy1FeZ","vGmLfA3R","khb32G0k","ZvR7ufZu","lfIMkupj","Jwsj9hnw","n9joHa1e","lW5W9ena","kWB5Orlp","YoeLPRqx","6HsZEX1E","shfvdKKK","NhH3bdcX","Obc6GFkK","AEjABoYz","c9Pa2Sap","qPlkTrvl","5VqjJ4M6","SMbXVy9A","3DtySnI3","KB42DIPY","4GgVhh2s","nGi7w36N","8qMOAA4B","pQo2WjRY","2mbM4NFn","33B4KCsj","NSmsdNiu","g3gquqif","FWwfvgYH","dgeCtXsu","fY95HR8z","48hFxWw7","M9XF5FlW","AK9FBEgo","BJSHfipe","y3LKh1gi","tqCNpIoc","tBrRMDS7","5U2bHbH6","rD3FWXH7","OpDYYPhR","jeq5Pk2P"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/LQ3K71Q1/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"MJxmQ042","project_id":"LQ3K71Q1","author_id":"HXiopoLj","featured":false,"name":"v3.2.1","version_number":"3.2.1","changelog":"-

WaveyCapes mod animates the cape in a more fluent way, adding physics and rendering it in one bent part instead of small cubes.

setting), which allows the cape to move left and right slightly, prevents too-hard bends/cape clipping into itself, and entirely new underwater physics and behavior.\n- Fixed a lot of edge cases, where the cape would become oddly thin, tilted, or inverted.\n- Using the Wind Mode \"Waves\" will now slow down while underwater.\n\n## FAQ\n\n- Q: How do I access the config screen?\n  A: The config screen is accessible via the mod-list (requires Mod Menu on fabric).\n- Q: Does this mod work on servers?\n  A: No, this mod is purely visual and fully clientside, so it doesn't have to be installed on servers.\n- Q: How do I get the cape to look like the older versions of the mod?\n  A: You can change between rendering styles, cape behavior, and wind effects in the config

This vector allows us to shift the start time for our rotation).\r\n- Added an experimental `multi-texture` skybox type ([wiki section](https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes/blob/1.20.x/dev/docs/schema-v2.md#multi-texture-skybox)).\r\n- Added contributing guidelines and a code of conduct.\r\n- Allowed fog color modification to also modify fog density.\r\n- Added a configuration file (`.minecraft/config/fabricskyboxes-config.json`).\r\n    - Saves enable state.\r\n    - Added a `keepVanillaBehaviour` flag.\r\n- Fixed the URL issue when using Sinytra Connector (#96).\r\n- Fixed the alpha rendering for the end skybox type.\r\n- Added a debugging HUD (Keybind is unbound, meant for resource pack authors).\r\n- Added vi_vn translations (#94) by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes/pull/94.\r\n- Improved performance for several skybox types.\r\n- Fixed cyclic fade alpha calculation.\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes/pull/94\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/AMereBagatelle/fabricskyboxes/compare/mc1.20.1-0.7.2...mc1.20.1-0.7.3","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-21T17:14:48.403898Z","downloads":582633,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"31a13b9ca0a500b4caad993ec42e1199142d86d1","sha512":"e71c12b81f10b42c06fac9719a2135c6d34f298fb12d926bce9aca6af8655b76ccb31dce9561543499a019e43e93cf4036dc051fe2a97ca2a8fe112f646a99a5"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/YBz7DOs8/versions/cezLH6eB/fabricskyboxes-0.7.3%2Bmc1.20.1.jar","filename":"fabricskyboxes-0.7.3+mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":207272,"file_type":null},{"hashes":{"sha1":"9dabd7fc37aedd8b48580dfed48ac32b9979ad7c","sha512":"1be0c4dcf981029c21d6e6c641e55c0d575e234a7839140280f9dc5fe94219001865083d9f69372820bdd1a0e8b0510f9cc3477ae0480d66bda63962dbf6dd1a"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/YBz7DOs8/versions/cezLH6eB/fabricskyboxes-0.7.3%2Bmc1.20.1-sources.jar","filename":"fabricskyboxes-0.7.3+mc1.20.1-sources.jar","primary":false,"size":134460,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"fXSWgsrG","user":{"id":"QXAY01zS","username":"FlashyReese","name":"FlashyReese","avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/30311066?v=4","bio":"https://flashyreese.me","created":"2020-10-23T09:28:46.803957Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Member","ordering":0},{"team_id":"fXSWgsrG","user":{"id":"ifLBWnLs","username":"AMereBagatelle","name":null,"avatar_url":"https://avatars3.githubusercontent.com/u/56981737?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-11-07T23:20:09.669752Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":null,"incompatible":true},"file_name":"fabricskyboxes-0.7.3+mc1.20.1.jar"},"mods\\cakechomps-fabric-6.1.0+1.20.1.jar":{"sha512":"80daefd4d9d641a68d9ad383ff09b66f6c42d53d62c601c74639778be2c929b8455b6ac723916f5fc1dcddbe9a459c0b3be5927c2518d3aa887610d16221e44c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"g646EoqQ","slug":"cake-chomps","project_type":"mod","team":"6FveEoeW","title":"Cake Chomps","description":"Adds sound and crumb particles when you eat cake.","body":"Cake Chomps is a mod that adds eating sounds and crumb particles, like when you're eating every other food item, to cakes.

prevent mobs from naturally despawning by naming them with a name tag.\n<br>\n<br>\nAdded a config : <h2><code>config/letmedespawn.json</code></h2>\n\n```\n/lmd reload\n```\nTo reload the config ingame after editing.\n```\n/lmd add <mobName>\n```\nTo add mobs to the config\n```\n/lmd remove <mobName>\n```\nTo remove mobs from the config.\n\nAll the commands update the mob list in realtime you dont need to run \"/lmd reload\" or restart the game after adding or removing mobs. \"**/lmd reload**\" is there incase you want to edit the config outside the game.\n<br>\n<br>\nThanks to Batdogduke64 for inspiration for the icon.\n<br>\n<br>\n</center>","published":"2022-08-21T22:24:10.240747Z","updated":"2024-06-01T17:38:25.936897Z","client_side":"unsupported","server_side":"required","downloads":1140302,"followers":664,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.12.2","1.16.5","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3-pre1","1.20.3-pre2","1.20.3-pre3","1.20.3-pre4","1.20.3-rc1","1.20.3","1.20.4-rc1","1.20.4","23w51a","23w51b","24w03a","24w03b","24w04a","24w05a","24w05b","24w06a","24w07a","24w09a","24w10a","24w11a","24w12a","24w13a","24w14potato","24w14a","1.20.5-pre1","1.20.5-pre2","1.20.5-pre3","1.20.5-pre4","1.20.5-rc1","1.20.5-rc2","1.20.5-rc3","1.20.5","1.20.6-rc1","1.20.6","24w18a","24w19a","24w19b","24w20a"],"loaders":["bukkit","fabric","forge","neoforge","paper","purpur","quilt"],"versions":["iwhYcUGA","z414UvHC","Q7HcW1wj","SEMsRN4x","GxiQF9u0","aPFboA2d","wiNkX0Xr","yxrgBOmL","lTFSicza","kyd9MmX5","FXwDxszl","OQLgE6Uv","xTKJ26av","kR8Wv8gw","qpC0XlcW","a1JZWhla","26Uop8I8","fxsM7yPK","CCOsRL93","Z136Eles"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/vE2FN5qn/2609f745e46bd92e57a67e1da07319eb2154c6f7.png"},"version":{"id":"qpC0XlcW","project_id":"vE2FN5qn","author_id":"nkUT94hf","featured":false,"name":"LMD-1.20.x-fabric-1.2.0","version_number":"1.2.0","changelog":"-

It derives from work\ndone in the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com/) and [Tuinity](https://github.com/Spottedleaf/Tuinity)\nprojects.\n\nKrypton contains several optimizations, including:\n\n* **Highly optimized Netty handlers** derived from the [Velocity](https://velocitypowered.com) proxy, which I am the developer of. These handlers have seen real-world usage and extensive profiling, and strategically deploy native code where it makes the most sense.\n* **Flush consolidation** to lower server CPU usage (and reducing the impact from hardware security vulnerabilities which exploit speculative execution) and lower server tick times.\n* **Micro-optimizations** to reduce memory usage and improve packet serialization speeds.\n\n[Please join my Discord](https://discord.gg/RUGArxEQ8J) to discuss the mod or get support.\n\n## Compatibility\n\nKrypton should work anywhere where a Minecraft can run &mdash; naturally, however, it is tuned for Linux.\n\nI try to ensure that Krypton will work with the Fabric API, Lithium, and Sodium.

[Website.](https://tr7zw.github.io/project/entityculling/)\n\nMinecraft skips rendering things that are behind you, so why is it rendering everything that you still can't see because of a wall in the way? This mod utilizes your other CPU cores/threads to do really quick path-tracing from your camera to all block/-entities to determine rather they are visible or not.

The difference is that Sodium does a really quick pass based on the visible chunks, being way less aggressive and thereby still rendering entities that just happen to be in visible chunks, but not visible themselves.\n\n## FAQ\n\n### Does this have to be installed on the Server?\n\nNo, this is fully Client-side and can't be installed on servers.\n\n### Will this influence farms/mobs?\n\nNo. Since this mod just skips the rendering, mobs will still spawn/move/drop items.\n\n## Credits\n\nRoboTricker created the original server-side async raytracing occlusion culling implementation for Transport-Pipes.","published":"2022-05-25T10:09:09.784330Z","updated":"2024-05-25T20:34:39.856745Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"unsupported","downloads":6631255,"followers":5038,"categories":["optimization"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["b1.7.3","1.7.10","1.8.8","1.8.9","1.12.2","1.16","1.16.1","1.16.2","1.16.3","1.16.4","1.16.5","1.17","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3-pre1","1.19.3-pre2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","forge","neoforge","quilt"],"versions":["WiIRU3UP","AXYavMt5","Qek7k92S","2WBkUuat","2mzFyULh","mlP64Wt9","4GD4dwQK","LQ3vI7aU","WdlVJYKE","R0KPBo5r","1Vc3QD0W","b2cBCjB4","bRBO9ZzX","Wq0up4B4","bE2TQ25z","reIgRPky","N7HJbtfe","AdkBUIRs","WR6z6MYC","twdGLDHv","jFORrKV6","d3CbGntl","UvJN5Cy4","NB6TPjI8","374z4jcq","d20sUcYn","17Hi340V","BDwHAdWc","1MBmcSf1","LwvhfrTE","tUVHg6HN","pVb6ajsR","DkksI437","KSu61vcB","Ek0VIX9q","mBYyh1qv","HSirwtwV","2I1m95aJ","M5k1QJL1","knltv3Vh","iC2A1KnJ","McVB9vXT","7JR5qJ8f","dmSSEQmZ","l1SLPhB6","bpznplxY","sXviAk4G","SLiFyIon","bketoxVs","frGGaFrx","gO8hxcyv","ugIRhLoi","2LyjkgAv","PG8gMKcT","4Nq7hEtl","hyejM5za","SzEdoick","UHcskdEO","92bPVm5F"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"BDwHAdWc","project_id":"NNAgCjsB","author_id":"Qnt13hO8","featured":true,"name":"1.6.2-1.20.2 - Fabric","version_number":"1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog":"## What's Changed\r\n* Update to 1.20.2\r\n* Create fr_fr.json by @Calvineries in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* Create vi_vn.json by @ImVietnam in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @Calvineries made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/119\r\n* @ImVietnam made their first contribution in https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/pull/118\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/tr7zw/EntityCulling/compare/1.6.2-1.20...1.6.2-1.20.2","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-09-22T17:08:01.300588Z","downloads":1879886,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"8e4be2bb9703deddb3d3d212c812cdc1f9de072b","sha512":"0080d3733f77e6b2e80e40d5d7bfe63dd125d94984bf92568d3434ff281f68123ec382ee53eba021278c01059299c12492dd518e61de1247f5cf7e8040bc98f1"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/NNAgCjsB/versions/BDwHAdWc/entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","filename":"entityculling-fabric-1.6.2-mc1.20.1.jar","primary":true,"size":59348,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[{"version_id":null,"project_id":"P7dR8mSH","file_name":null,"dependency_type":"required"}],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"members":[{"team_id":"hLPrl6Gq","user":{"id":"poie5Iwy","username":"vicisacat","name":"vicisacat","avatar_url":null,"bio":"I made the Entity Culling port for beta 1.7.3 and that's it.

These bounties often ask for you to bring back an item, or kill some mobs in return for whatever rewards they're offering. If you can complete the bounty, you just have to bring it back to the bounty board and right click the board to redeem your rewards!\n\n\n### Decrees\n\nThere exists another item as well, called a Decree. A Decree determines what kind of bounties show up on a bounty board. For example, an Armorsmith's Decree makes it so that objectives and rewards related to armor show up on the board (leather, iron, chestplates, boots, etc). You can have up to three decrees on a bounty board at once, and it will mix and match objectives and rewards from all three when new bounties appear!\n\nYou can find new Decrees as rewards for certain bounties, or make your own. Crafting your own will create a random decree when you place it onto the board.\n\n### Bounty Tiers\n\nJust like items, bounties can have different tiers of rarity. Some bounty rewards are more rare than others, and bounties with higher rarity have a better chance of having these more rare rewards! Rarity follows the same pattern as in vanilla: Common, Uncommon, Rare and Epic.\n\n### Reputation\n\nAll bounty boards have their own value associated with them called \"Reputation\". As you turn in more bounties, this number goes up! The higher the reputation, the more often rare bounties show up on the bounty board. Some bounty rewards may not even show up until you reach high enough reputations.\n\n### Compat\n\nCurrently, I've added some support for some items from different Fabric mods. Feel free to suggest compat with other Fabric mods (but I may be stingy! For example: I'm not likely to add compat with items that involve a lot of time to craft, since it may break progression for some modpacks).\n\n \n\nI plan on adding more in the future!\n\n### Why?\n\nI originally made this mod so that I could be given some goals to accomplish, which would stave off boredom.

Slot groups are collections of slots for a certain body part or more vague area. By default there are 6 slot groups (head, chest, legs, feet, offhand, hand) that can have slots added to them, but more groups can be added if desired. Trinkets' UI is intuitive to use, accessible, and attempts to do away with clutter. Its system means that you'll never have a slot that's not used for anything, as mods request the slots they want.\n\nFor basic tutorials and comprehensive documentation, visit this project's [wiki](https://github.com/emilyploszaj/trinkets/wiki/Home).\n","published":"2021-06-08T00:05:32.472592Z","updated":"2024-05-26T19:08:53.744849Z","client_side":"required","server_side":"required","downloads":1298410,"followers":1032,"categories":["equipment","library","utility"],"additional_categories":[],"game_versions":["1.17-rc2","1.17.1","1.18","1.18.1","1.18.2","1.19","1.19.1","1.19.2","1.19.3","1.19.4","1.20","1.20.1","1.20.2","1.20.3","1.20.4","1.20.5","1.20.6"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"],"versions":["70Ajg5iP","dRgbv7A2","29Jd2Dm4","qpiOPBB9","R2UW6ejS","FdJA5sbK","DtvgyMK2","vOuy3Z5S","XqLNMi9J","WiXqMygm","oLUBJhyv","9qrmAiwv","OLwsMJv4","5zEAvqnX","A5kxdEY3","z8ProfKL","e563ycts","tJ23Vcff","AHxQGtuC","7aQD4OG8","SGjPO8H9"],"icon_url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/icon.png"},"version":{"id":"e563ycts","project_id":"5aaWibi9","author_id":"R6WsWKy9","featured":false,"name":"Trinkets 3.7.1","version_number":"3.7.1","changelog":"### Additions\n* Added zh_cn language support\n\n### Fixes\n* Properly expose CCA dependencies for new Loom versions\n* Target the new CCA Maven","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2023-07-22T01:20:47.934095Z","downloads":683069,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha512":"e2869ce20fc87025a8a7d2cbca58ff4857f287004141f51e4b297ea240c18950d5c0ddff258547731974a763efd835d8c3c283804dae03a42e31cb761800f75d","sha1":"eb2a91a80d18513ca0b9ea3f76fc86422166e440"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/e563ycts/trinkets-3.7.1.jar","filename":"trinkets-3.7.1.jar","primary":true,"size":234448,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric","quilt"]},"members":[{"team_id":"F0xlmrbH","user":{"id":"R6WsWKy9","username":"Emi","name":"Emi","avatar_url":"https://avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/14813658?v=4","bio":null,"created":"2020-10-26T21:52:52.726926Z","role":"developer"},"role":"Owner","ordering":0}],"update_version":{"id":"AHxQGtuC","project_id":"5aaWibi9","author_id":"R6WsWKy9","featured":false,"name":"Trinkets 3.7.2","version_number":"3.7.2","changelog":"","changelog_url":null,"date_published":"2024-03-11T04:25:11.224830Z","downloads":204830,"version_type":"release","files":[{"hashes":{"sha1":"d58cc8759587f03f320f188972ca66baa788d008","sha512":"bedf97c87c5e556416410267108ad358b32806448be24ef8ae1a79ac63b78b48b9c851c00c845b8aedfc7805601385420716b9e65326fdab21340e8ba3cc4274"},"url":"https://cdn.modrinth.com/data/5aaWibi9/versions/AHxQGtuC/trinkets-3.7.2.jar","filename":"trinkets-3.7.2.jar","primary":true,"size":238532,"file_type":null}],"dependencies":[],"game_versions":["1.20","1.20.1"],"loaders":["fabric"]},"incompatible":true},"file_name":"[前置] trinkets-3.7.1.jar"},"mods\\eugenes-wealthy-plains-village-1.0.1.jar":{"sha512":"7f2f8fcd32fa9858b1944ea6de33639845cdca3efd8a6d7af13fae078df3cad361e23cfbd42cb4cd93e76a304d6976fdd190d31ea845e34276fdc40d3e54b09c","disabled":false,"metadata":{"type":"modrinth","project":{"id":"XYcNKW0i","slug":"eugenes-wealthy-plains-village","project_type":"mod","team":"pcNfzZuq","title":"Eugene's Wealthy Plains Village","description":"Overhaul your plains village for better looking and experience.","body":"This is originally for modpack [AnimateCraft: Lankeren](https://modrinth.com/modpack/animatecraft-lankeren).

If you feed them a Golden Apple, they&rsquo;ll allow you to ride them for 30 seconds. During this time, Maps&rsquo; radius are greatly increased. To breed them, use a Hay Bale!</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Elephants</strong> mosey around, minding their own business. They fight back when attacked.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Hippos</strong> tend to stay near the water, but watch out, because they&rsquo;re <em>always</em> hungry! They&rsquo;ll attack boats and any Players that go into their pool. To breed them, feed them a Glistering Melon or a Melon Block while they&rsquo;re in the water.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Rhinos</strong> are generally docile unless they have a baby with them. If aggro&rsquo;d, or if their baby is approached, they will scrape their foot 4-5 times before <em><strong>charging!</strong></em></span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Vultures</strong> fly around, squawking in the air. Come nightfall, they&rsquo;ll attack <strong>Zombies.</strong> When Players are low on health, Vultures will swoop down, stealing the item in the Player&rsquo;s hand. If a Vulture steals an item, they&rsquo;ll carry it around while flying. If Rotten Flesh is dropped on the ground, they&rsquo;ll trade out the item they&rsquo;re holding.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Zebras</strong> are the Savanna&rsquo;s equivalent of Horses, and are tameable in a similar way. They&rsquo;re a slippery bunch though, and will run away if approached! However, once tamed, they run faster than Horses while in water, and can be chested.</span></li>\n<li><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\"><strong>Boars</strong> are neutral animals that replace Pigs in Savanna biomes. When attacked, they will fight back, and run away when low on health. I wonder what happens if they&rsquo;re struck by lightning..</span></li>\n<li></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 14px;\">For more detailed information about each mob, click <a href=\"https://starfish-studios.com/mods/naturalist\">here</a> to read our official wiki.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2><span style=\"font-size: 18px;\"><strong><b>⚠️</b> Frequently Asked Questions&nbsp;<b>⚠️</b></strong></span></h2>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<div class=\"spoiler\">\n<p><strong>Q : Can I use this mod in my modpack or make videos about it?</strong><br />A : Yes!

Off = No sneaking\n  - Maintain = Keep sneaking if you were when the inventory opened (default)\n  - Pressed = Sneak only while holding the sneak button (can be distracting when shift-clicking)\n- Allow Dismounting: Allow dismounting from mounts in inventories (overrides \"Sneak Mode\" while on a mount)\n- Text Field Disables Movement: Disable movement when a text field is focused (like search bars or in an anvil)\n\n#### UI Background:\n- Hide Inventory Backgrounds: Hides the background tint while in inventories.\n- Pause Screens Background: How to handle screens that pause the game:\n  -

You usually would be forced to restart, even though you didn't really do anything wrong. Maybe\nyour friend didn't do anything wrong either. Overall I believe that death in hardcore is only fun if it feels like you\nreally deserved it, for example while fighting a strong boss monster.\n\nTherefore, this mod aims to solve this problem! When a player dies, instead of being gone for good, they enter a K.O.\nstate, at which point a timer will start running. Being the good friend you are, you can attempt to save them in time.\nIf you do, everything is fine - they get a small debuff and a strong appetite and you two can be on your way again. If\nyou don't, for example because you died while trying to save them, or you just didn't ~~care about your friend~~ get there\nin time, then that's your own fault and you can now decide to restart while in peace with yourself!\n\n<p>\n    <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https://modrinth.com/mod/balm\"> \n        <img src=\"https://blay09.net/files/brand/requires_balm.png\"

and works automatically with any stair/slab or any carpet combination, modded ones included.\n\nTo get a carpet stair simply place a carpet item on any upward facing stair block.\n\nTo remove it just break the block normally.\n\n<center>\n\n## ❤️Support Me❤️\n</center>\n\n<p><span style=\"font-size:18px\">Modding is taking a lot of my time, so if you like what I do, and you would like to support
